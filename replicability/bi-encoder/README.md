The source code and data used to replicate the bi-encoder retriever are available [here](https://github.com/viswavi/datafinder/tree/main).

We provided two files:
- the testa data : this file contains the test query set except for thoe duplicated keyphrase queries which were excluded
- the qrels file : they have been generated relying on the original qrels provided for the fullsentence queries. We mapped the QueryID of the full sentence queries to the QueryID of the keyphrase queries.
