The original code, data, and instructions to run the code and that we followed to replicate the results are available [here](https://github.com/michaelfaerber/datarec), in particular we replicated the code of the LinearSVM implementation with tf-idf text representation.


In the results folder we added the results obtained replicating the method with abstracts and citation contexts.
