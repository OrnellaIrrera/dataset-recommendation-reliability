https://makg.org/entity/2047221353	KDD This paper presents an approach to automatically optimizing the retrieval quality of search engines using clickthrough data Intuitively a good information retrieval system should present relevant documents high in the ranking with less relevant documents following below While previous approaches to learning retrieval functions from examples exist they typically require training data generated from relevance judgments by experts This makes them difficult and expensive to apply The goal of this paper is to develop a method that utilizes clickthrough data for training namely the querylog of the search engine in connection with the log of links the users clicked on in the presented ranking Such clickthrough data is available in abundance and can be recorded at very low cost Taking a Support Vector Machine SVM approach this paper presents a method for learning retrieval functions From a theoretical perspective this method is shown to be wellfounded in a risk minimization framework Furthermore it is shown to be feasible even for large sets of queries and features The theoretical results are verified in a controlled experiment It shows that the method can effectively adapt the retrieval function of a metasearch engine to a particular group of users outperforming Google in terms of retrieval quality after only a couple of hundred training examples	https://makg.org/entity/2955421345, https://makg.org/entity/2899259597

https://makg.org/entity/2151367131	Estimating the Effect of Training Programs on Earnings GOVERNMENTAL postschooling training programs have become a permanent fixture of the US economy in the last decade These programs are typically advocated for diverse reasons 1 to reduce inflation by the provision of more skilled workers to alleviate shortages 2 to reduce unemployment of certain groups and 3 to reduce poverty by increasing the skills of certain groups All of these objectives require that training programs increase the earnings of trainees above what they otherwise would be For example alleviating shortages by training more highly skilled workers should increase the earnings of these workers Likewise the concern for unemployed workers is derived from a concern for the decreased earnings of these workers and if trainees subsequently suffer less unemployment their earnings should be higher Finally training programs are intended to reduce poverty by increasing the earnings of low income workers Evaluating the success of training programs is thus inherently a quantitative assessment of the effect of training on trainee earnings It is an important process both because it helps to inform discussions of public policy by shedding light on the past value of these programs as investments and because it can provide a means of testing our ability to augment the human capital of certain workers Although there have been many studies of the effect of postschool classroom training on earnings it is by now rather widely agreed that very little is reliably known about the actual effects of these programs2 Three main problems account for this state of affairs 1 the large sample sizes required to detect relatively small anticipated program effects in a variable with such high variance as earnings 2 the considerable expense required to keep track of trainees over a long enough period of time to measure the full intertemporal impact of training and 3 the extreme difficulty of implementing an adequate experimental design so as to obtain a group against which to reliably compare trainees3 The purpose of this paper is to report on efforts to cope with this third problem using a data collection system that comes some way towards resolving the first two The basic idea of this data system is to match the program record on each trainee with the trainees Social Security earnings history The Social Security Administration maintains a summary yearbyyear earnings history for each Social Security account over the period since 1950 that may be used under the appropriate confidentiality restrictions for this purpose4 In this paper I have concentrated on an analysis of all classroom trainees who started training under the Manpower Development and Training Act MDTA in the first 3 months of 1964 so as to ensure their having completed training in that year In choosing to analyze trainees from so early a cohort something is clearly lost On the one hand the nature of the participants in these early years was considerably different than in the later years In particular programs geared Received for publication February 9 1977 Revision accepted for publication August 1 1977  Princeton University This research was supported by ASPER US Department of Labor but does not represent an official position of the Department of Labor its agencies or staff I would like to thank Gregory Chow Ronald Ehrenberg Roger Gordon Zvi Griliches George E Johnson Nicholas Kiefer Richard Quandt and Sherwin Rosen for helpful comments I also owe a heavy debt to D Alton Smith for computational and other assistance See Reid 1976 for example for a clear analysis of how knowledge of these effects is required in order to establish the impact of government training on the blackwhite wage differential 2 Surveys of many of these studies may be found in Stromsdorfer 1972 and ONeill 1973 3For further discussion of these points see Ashenfelter 1975 4The idea for using these data to analyze the effectiveness of government training programs is apparently quite an old one having been suggested by the National Manpower Advisory Committee US Department of Labor 1972 to the Secretary of Labor at its first meeting in a letter dated October 10 1962 the year of passage of the Manpower Development and Training Act Actual efforts along these lines were ultimately reported by Borus 1967 Commins 1970 Farber 1970 and Prescott and Cooley 1972	https://makg.org/entity/2992347581

https://makg.org/entity/2108681472	A constructive model for the development of joint attention This paper presents a constructive model by which a robot acquires the ability of joint attention with a human caregiver based on its embedded mechanisms of visual attention and learning with selfevaluation The former is to look at a salient object in the robots view and the latter is to learn sensorimotor coordination when visual attention has succeeded Since the success of visual attention does not always correspond to the success of joint attention the robot has incorrect learning data for joint attention as well as correct data However the robot is expected statistically to lose incorrect data as outliers since such data do not have any correlation in the sensorimotor coordination while correct data have a correlation The robot consequently acquires the ability of joint attention by finding the correlation in the sensorimotor coordination even if multiple objects are placed at random positions in an environment and a human caregiver does not provide any task evaluation to the robot The experimental results show that the proposed model makes the robot reproduce the developmental process of infants joint attention Therefore the proposed model could be one of the models to explain how infants develop the ability of joint attention	https://makg.org/entity/2781744262

https://makg.org/entity/2275408670	SODA Population protocols are a popular model of distributed computing in which randomlyinteracting agents with little computational power cooperate to jointly perform computational tasks Inspired by developments in molecular computation and in particular DNA computing recent algorithmic work has focused on the complexity of solving simple yet fundamental tasks in the population model such as leader election which requires convergence to a single agent in a special quotleaderquot state and majority in which agents must converge to a decision as to which of two possible initial states had higher initial count Known results point towards an inherent tradeoff between the time complexity of such algorithms and the space complexity ie size of the memory available to each agent In this paper we explore this tradeoff and provide new upper and lower bounds for majority and leader election First we prove a unified lower bound which relates the space available per node with the time complexity achievable by a protocol for instance our result implies that any protocol solving either of these tasks for n agents using Olog log n states must take npolylogn expected time This is the first result to characterize time complexity for protocols which employ superconstant number of states per node and proves that fast polylogarithmic running times require protocols to have relatively large space costs On the positive side we give algorithms showing that fast polylogarithmic convergence time can be achieved using Olog2 n space per node in the case of both tasks Overall our results highlight a time complexity separation between O log log n and log2 n state space size for both majority and leader election in population protocols and introduce new techniques which should be applicable more broadly	https://makg.org/entity/2963640111, https://makg.org/entity/2963477229

https://makg.org/entity/2160328559	Why cant you tickle yourself It is well known that you cannot tickle yourself Here we discuss the proposal that such attenuation of selfproduced tactile stimulation is due to the sensory predictions made by an internal forward model of the motor system A forward model predicts the sensory consequences of a movement based on the motor command When a movement is selfproduced its sensory consequences can be accurately predicted and this prediction can be used to attenuate the sensory effects of the movement Studies are reviewed that demonstrate that as the discrepancy between predicted and actual sensory feedback increases during selfproduced tactile stimulation there is a concomitant decrease in the level of sensory attenuation and an increase in tickliness Functional neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that this sensory attenuation might be mediated by somatosensory cortex and anterior cingulate cortex these areas are activated less by a selfproduced tactile stimulus than by the same stimulus when it is externally produced Furthermore evidence suggests that the cerebellum might be involved in generating the prediction of the sensory consequences of movement Finally recent evidence suggests that this predictive mechanism is abnormal in patients with auditory hallucinations andor passivity experiences	https://makg.org/entity/2781744262
