Here we report evidence that the intrinsic ocean dynamics of the deep equatorial Atlantic can also affect sea surface temperature, wind and rainfall in the tropical Atlantic region and constitutes a 4.5-yr climate cycle. Specifically, vertically alternating deep zonal jets of short vertical wavelength with a period of about 4.5 yr and amplitudes of more than 10 cm s\u22121 are observed, in the deep Atlantic, to propagate their energy upwards, towards the surface10, 11. They are linked, at the sea surface, to equatorial zonal current anomalies and eastern Atlantic temperature anomalies that have amplitudes of about 6 cm s\u22121 and 0.4 \u00b0C, respectively, and are associated with distinct wind and rainfall patterns. Although deep jets are also observed in the Pacific12 and Indian13 oceans, only the Atlantic deep jets seem to oscillate on interannual timescales. Our knowledge of the persistence and regularity of these jets is limited by the availability of high-quality data. Despite this caveat, the oscillatory behaviour can still be used to improve predictions of sea surface temperature in the tropical Atlantic. Deep-jet generation and upward energy transmission through the Equatorial Undercurrent warrant further theoretical study.", "title": "Interannual atmospheric variability forced by the deep equatorial Atlantic Ocean", "query": "Interannual atmospheric variability forced by the deep equatorial Atlantic Ocean"}

There is a wide range of approaches to developing SDMs, each highlighting different characteristics of both the data and the ecology of the species or assemblages represented by the data. Yet, signals of species co-occurrences in community data are usually ignored, due to the assumption that such structuring roles of species co-occurrences are limited to small spatial scales and require experimental studies to be detected. Here, our aim is to explore associations among marine sandy-bottom sediment inhabitants and test for the structuring effect of seagrass on co-occurrences among these species across a New Zealand intertidal sandflat, using a joint species distribution model (JSDM).Results:We ran a JSDM on a total of 27 macrobenthic species co-occurring in 300,000 m 2 of sandflat. These species represented all major taxonomic groups, i.e. polychaetes, bivalves and crustaceans, collected in 400 sampling locations. A number of significant co-occurrences due to shared habitat preferences were present in vegetated areas, where negative and positive correlations were approximately equally common. A few species, among them the gastropods Cominella glandiformis and Notoacmea scapha, co-occurred randomly with other seagrass benthic inhabitants. Residual correlations were less apparent and mostly positive. In bare sand flats shared habitat preferences resulted in many significant co-occurrences of benthic species. Moreover, many negative and positive residual patterns between benthic species remained after accounting for habitat preferences. Some species occurring in both habitats showed similarities in their correlations, such as the polychaete Aglaophamus macroura, which shared habitat preferences with many other benthic species in both habitats, yet no residual correlations remained in either habitat.Conclusions: Firstly, analyses based on a latent variable approach to joint distributions stressed the structuring role of species co-occurrences beyond experimental scales. Secondly, results showed context dependent interactions, highlighted by species having more interconnected networks in New Zealand bare sediment sandflats than in seagrass meadows. These findings stress the critical importance of natural history to modelling, as well as incorporating ecological reality in SDMs.", "title": "Co-occurrence patterns and the large-scale spatial structure of benthic communities in seagrass meadows and bare sand", "query": "Co-occurrence patterns and the large-scale spatial structure of benthic communities in seagrass meadows and bare sand"}

Berkner dust displays an overall crust-like isotopic signature, characterized by more radiogenic 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and much less radiogenic 143 Nd/ 144 Nd compared to dust deposited on the EAP during glacial periods. Differences with EAP interglacial dust are not as marked but still significant, indicating that present-day Berkner dust provenance is distinct, at least to some extent, from that of the dust reaching the EAP. The fourteen snow-pit sub-seasonal samples that were obtained span a two-year period (2002)(2003) and their dust Sr and Nd isotopic composition reveals that multiple sources are at play over a yearly time period. Southern South America, Patagonia in particular, likely accounts for part of the observed spring/summer dust deposition maxima, when isotopic composition is shifted towards \\younger\\ isotopic signatures. In the spring, possible additional inputs from Australian sources would also be supported by the data. Most of the year, however, the measured isotopic signatures would be best explained by a sustained background supply from putative local sources in East Antarctica, which carry old-crust-like isotopic fingerprints. Whether the restricted East Antarctic ice-free areas produce sufficient eolian material has yet to be substantiated however. The fact that large (N 5 \u03bcm) particles represent a significant fraction of the samples throughout the entire time-series supports scenarios that involve contributions from proximal sources, either in Patagonia and/or Antarctica (possibly including snow-free areas in the Antarctic Peninsula and other areas as well).

Accurately assessing coral calcification rates is crucial to determine the health of these ecosystems and their response to major environmental changes such as ocean warming and acidification. Several approaches have been used to assess rates of coral calcification, but there is a real need to compare these approaches in order to ascertain that high-quality and intercomparable results can be produced. Here, we assessed four methods (total alkalinity anomaly, calcium anomaly, 45 Ca incorporation, and 13 C incorporation) to determine coral calcification of the reefbuilding coral Stylophora pistillata. Given the importance of environmental conditions for this process, the study was performed under two starting pH levels (ambient: 8.05 and low: 7.2) and two light (light and dark) conditions. Under all conditions, calcification rates estimated using the alkalinity and calcium anomaly techniques as well as 45 Ca incorporation were highly correlated. Such a strong correlation between the alkalinity anomaly and 45 Ca incorporation techniques has not been observed in previous studies and most probably results from improvements described in the present paper. The only method which provided calcification rates significantly different from the other three techniques was 13 C incorporation. Calcification rates based on this method were consistently higher than those measured using the other techniques. Although reasons for these discrepancies remain unclear, the use of this technique for assessing calcification rates in corals is not recommended without further investigations.", "title": "Intercomparison of four methods to estimate coral calcification under various environmental conditions", "query": "Intercomparison of four methods to estimate coral calcification under various environmental conditions"}

Despite these fast environmental changes, we currently know little about the effects of ocean acidification (OA) on marine key species in this area. Moreover, the existing studies typically test the effects of OA under constant, hence artificial, light fields. In this study, the abundant Arctic picoeukaryote Micromonas pusilla was acclimated to current (400 \u00b5atm) and future (1000 \u00b5atm) pCO 2 levels under a constant as well as a dynamic light, simulating more realistic light fields as experienced in the upper mixed layer. To describe and understand the responses to these drivers, growth, particulate organic carbon (POC) production, elemental composition, photophysiology and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were analysed. M. pusilla was able to benefit from OA on various scales, ranging from an increase in growth rates to enhanced photosynthetic capacity, irrespective of the light regime. These beneficial effects were, however, not reflected in the POC production rates, which can be explained by energy partitioning towards cell division rather than biomass build-up. In the dynamic light regime, M. pusilla was able to optimize its photophysiology for effective light usage during both low-and high-light periods. This photoacclimative response, which was achieved by modifications to photosystem II (PSII), imposed high metabolic costs leading to a reduction in growth and POC production rates when compared to constant light. There were no significant interactions observed between dynamic light and OA, indicating that M. pusilla is able to maintain effective photoacclimation without increased photoinactivation under high pCO 2 . Based on these findings, M. pusilla is likely to cope well with future conditions in the Arctic Ocean.", "title": "The Arctic picoeukaryote Micromonas pusilla benefits from ocean acidification under constant and dynamic light", "query": "The Arctic picoeukaryote Micromonas pusilla benefits from ocean acidification under constant and dynamic light"}

The high 3 He/ 4 He ratio (up to 18 times higher than that of the atmosphere) and spatiotemporal 40 Ar/ 39 Ar geochronology suggest that the source material of the JFR is derived from the lower mantle and transferred to the surface by a relatively stationary plume. We used new whole-rock geochemical data (major-element, trace-element, and Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic data) for representative samples from the shield-stage of volcanism in the JFR (from O'Higgins Guyot, Alpha Seamount, Robinson Crusoe Island, and Alejandro Selkirk Island) to develop a petrogenetic model with the goal of understanding the temporal and spatial evolution of magmatism along the JFR. The shield-building lavas of JFR consist primarily of tholeiitic to alkalic basalts. Their compositional differences are explained by the fractional crystallization of olivine and clinopyroxene \u00b1 plagioclase, magmatic recharge, melt mixing, and olivine accumulation. Radiogenic Sr-Nd-Pb isotopes show a narrow field within the compositional range of the common FOZO mantle. The 206 Pb/ 204 Pb and 207 Pb/ 204 Pb ratios of JFR lavas are similar to those of other islands on the Nazca Plate (e.g., San F\u00e9lix and San Ambrosio). However, the JFR lavas are more radiogenic and show a narrower compositional range compared to the Easter Seamount Chain. The low CaO content at a given MgO content, moderate Ti-Ta-Nb 'TITAN' anomaly, fractionated heavy rare earth element values, and isotopic composition of JFR lavas are consistent with the presence of pyroxenite (recycled oceanic crust) in the mantle source. To estimate source parameters, we used OBS1 software (Kimura and Kawabata, 2015) to calculate the potential temperature (1316\u00b0C-1412\u00b0C), total degree of melting (3.4-19.2 wt%), and pyroxenite fraction (0.6-18.4 wt%) of the mantle beneath JFR. The temporal changes in the thermal, compositional, and lithologic characteristics of the source material can explain the chemical differences observed between different JFR volcanoes. We propose that shieldstage volcanism in JFR is largely generated by the melting of pyroxenite in a relatively low-temperature mantle plume.

To provide some insights into this, we here analysed 3 single-cell amplified genomes (SAGs) of the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis, whose genome is known. Our results show that each SAG has a different, independent bias, yielding different levels of genome recovery for each cell (6-36%). Genes often appear fragmented and are split into more genes during annotation. Thus, analyses of gene gain and losses, gene architectures, synteny and other genomic features can not be addressed with a single SAG. However, the recovery of phylogenetically-informative protein domains can be up to 55%. This means SAG data can be used to perform accurate phylogenomic analyses. Finally, we also confirm that the co-assembly of several SAGs improves the general genomic recovery.

In these regions, euphausiids are an important trophic link between primary producers and higher trophic levels. The species are known as pronounced diel vertical migrators, thus facing different levels of oxygen and temperature within a 24 h cycle. Declining oxygen levels may lead to vertically constrained habitats in euphausiids, which consequently will affect several trophic levels in the food web of the respective ecosystem. By using the regulation index (RI), the present study aimed at investigating the hypoxia tolerances of different euphausiid species from Atlantic, Pacific as well as from Polar regions. RI was calculated from 141 data sets and used to differentiate between respiration strategies using median and quartile (Q) values: low degree of oxyregulation (0.25 0.25 or Q3 > 0.75); and metabolic suppression (RI median, Q1 and Q3 0) was identified for the neritic temperate species Thysanoessa spinifera and the tropical species Euphausia lamelligera. RI values of Euphausia distinguenda and the Humboldt species Euphausia mucronata qualified these as metabolic suppressors. RI showed a significant impact of temperature on the respiration strategy of E. hanseni from oxyregulation to metabolic suppression. The species' estimated hypoxia tolerances and the degree of oxyconformity vs. oxyregulation were linked to diel vertical migration behavior and the temperature experienced during migration. The results highlight that the euphausiid species investigated have evolved various strategies to deal with different levels of oxygen, ranging from species showing a high degree of oxyconformity to strong oxyregulation. Neritic species may be more affected by hypoxia, as these are often short-distance-migrators and only adapted to a narrow range of environmental conditions.", "title": "Hypoxia Tolerance of 10 Euphausiid Species in Relation to Vertical Temperature and Oxygen Gradients", "query": "Hypoxia Tolerance of 10 Euphausiid Species in Relation to Vertical Temperature and Oxygen Gradients"}

Marine20 is intended for calibration of marine radiocarbon samples from non-polar regions; it is not suitable for calibration in polar regions where variability in sea ice extent, ocean upwelling and air-sea gas exchange may have caused larger changes to concentrations of marine radiocarbon. The Marine20 curve is based upon 500 simulations with an ocean/atmosphere/biosphere box-model of the global carbon cycle that has been forced by posterior realizations of our Northern Hemispheric atmospheric IntCal20 14 C curve and reconstructed changes in CO 2 obtained from ice core data. These forcings enable us to incorporate carbon cycle dynamics and temporal changes in the atmospheric 14 C level. The box-model simulations of the global-average marine radiocarbon reservoir age are similar to those of a more complex three-dimensional ocean general circulation model. However, simplicity and speed of the box model allow us to use a Monte Carlo approach to rigorously propagate the uncertainty in both the historic concentration of atmospheric 14 C and other key parameters of the carbon cycle through to our final Marine20 calibration curve.

Hatch length displayed CO 2 \u00d7 temperature interactions due largely to reduced hatch size at 24 \u2022 C in one experiment but increased length at 28 \u2022 C in another. We found no overall influence of CO 2 on larval growth or survival to 9, 10, 15 and 13-22 days post-hatch, at 28, 24, 20, and 17 \u2022 C, respectively.

A comparison of Holocene SST records stemming from the two commonly applied paleothermometry methods reveals contrasting \u2013 sometimes divergent \u2013 SST evolution, particularly at low latitudes where SST records are abundant enough to infer systematic discrepancies at a regional scale. Opposite SST trends at particular locations could be explained by out-of-phase trends in seasonal insolation during the Holocene. This hypothesis assumes that a strong contrast in the ecological responses of coccolithophores and planktonic foraminifera to winter and summer oceanographic conditions is the ultimate reason for seasonal differences in the origin of the temperature signal provided by these organisms. As a simple test for this hypothesis, Eemian SST records are considered because the Holocene and Eemian time periods experienced comparable changes in orbital con\ufb01gurations, but had a higher magnitude in insolation variance during the Eemian. For several regions, SST changes during both interglacials were of a similar sign, but with higher magnitudes during the Eemian as compared to the Holocene.

The climatology is obtained from a pattern recognition algorithm applied to stratification profiles from the Argo global array. The stratification features are identified as permanent upper ocean pycnostad and pycnocline even when the seasonal pycnocline is developed. The climatology shows that both Northern Hemisphere subtropical gyres have a qualitatively very similar stratification structure. The permanent pycnoclines in the North Atlantic and North Pacific show two deep centers colocated with thick subtropical and subpolar mode waters. These centers coincide with modes in the density and stratification space. These deep pycnocline centers are separated by a region with a shallower and thinner permanent pycnocline that is located downstream of Western Boundary Current Extensions and upstream of Eastern Subtropical Fronts. This feature creates a remarkable double-bowl pattern at the basin scale. In the subtropical gyres of the South Atlantic and South Pacific Oceans, the mode water and permanent pycnocline structures are characterized by two modes in the density and stratification space that, unlike in the Northern Hemisphere, do not necessarily correspond to deep and thick permanent pycnocline regions. In the subtropical gyre of the South Indian Ocean, a single mode is found to correspond to a single center in the western part of the gyre. This study also shows that away from these deep centers where the pycnocline depth almost follows isopycnals, the permanent pycnocline experiences significant thermohaline gradients that are not density compensated.Plain Language SummaryThe vertical structure of the ocean is of great importance to understand the impact of climate changes on the global ocean because a larger density differences (i.e., increased stratification) between the upper and the deeper ocean can prevent anthropogenic excess of heat, and carbon, from reaching the abyssal ocean. Using data from autonomous Argo floats that sample the ocean properties (e.g., temperature and salinity) from the surface down to 2,000 m, we describe the vertical structure of the ocean's surface layers at midlatitudes, where heat is mostly stored in the upper 1,000 m. This new study shows for the first time (i) a strong dependence of the ocean properties of the surface layer with the ocean properties of the transition layer with the abyss and (ii) that this transition layer exhibits rapid changes in temperature and density when rising to the surface as well as in the center of the each oceans. These new results are a significant refinement to the classic depiction of the midlatitude ocean as a simple bowl of warm water separated from the abyss by a layer of constant density and thus provide an accurate benchmark for climate models to detect long-term changes in the ocean vertical structure.", "title": "Subtropical Mode Water and Permanent Pycnocline Properties in the World Ocean", "query": "Subtropical Mode Water and Permanent Pycnocline Properties in the World Ocean"}

We visited the vents on the eastern flank of the small Menez Gwen volcano during cruises with RV Poseidon (POS402, 2010) and RV Meteor (M82/3, 2010), and used new bathymetry and imagery data to provide first detailed information on the extents, surface morphologies, spatial patterns of the hydrothermal discharge and the distribution of dominant megafauna of five active sites.

Arctic lakes have different origins and include the predominant thermokarst lakes, which are small, young and highly dynamic, as well as large, old and stable glacial lakes. Freshwater diatoms dominate the primary producer community in these lakes and can be used to detect biotic responses to climate and environmental change. We used specific diatom metabarcoding on sedimentary DNA, combined with next-generation sequencing and diatom morphology, to assess diatom diversity in five glacial and 15 thermokarst lakes within the easternmost expanse of the Siberian treeline ecotone in Chukotka, Russia. We obtained 163 verified diatom sequence types and identified 176 diatom species morphologically. Although there were large differences in taxonomic assignment using the two approaches, they showed similar high abundances and diversity of Fragilariceae and Aulacoseiraceae. In particular, the genetic approach detected hidden within-lake variations of fragilarioids in glacial lakes and dominance of centric Aulacoseira species, whereas Lindavia ocellata was predominant using morphology. In thermokarst lakes, sequence types and valve counts also detected high diversity of Fragilariaceae, which followed the vegetation gradient along the treeline. Ordination analyses of the genetic data from glacial and thermokarst lakes suggest that concentrations of sulfate (SO42\u2212), an indicator of the activity of sulfate-reducing microbes under anoxic conditions, and bicarbonate (HCO3\u2212), which relates to surrounding vegetation, have a significant influence on diatom community composition. For thermokarst lakes, we also identified lake depth as an important variable, but SO42\u2212 best explains diatom diversity derived from genetic data, whereas HCO3\u2212 best explains the data from valve counts. Higher diatom diversity was detected in glacial lakes, most likely related to greater lake age and different edaphic settings, which gave rise to diversification and endemism. In contrast, small, dynamic thermokarst lakes are inhabited by stress-tolerant fragilarioids and are related to different vegetation types along the treeline ecotone. Our study demonstrated that genetic investigations of lake sediments can be used to interpret climate and environmental responses of diatoms. It also showed how lake type affects diatom diversity, and that such genetic analyses can be used to track diatom community changes under ongoing warming in the Arctic.", "title": "Genetic and morphologic determination of diatom community composition in surface sediments from glacial and thermokarst lakes in the Siberian Arctic", "query": "Genetic and morphologic determination of diatom community composition in surface sediments from glacial and thermokarst lakes in the Siberian Arctic"}

Spatial and temporal variation in community composition contribute to these patterns of biodiversity, but how this variation and its underlying processes change across latitude remains unresolved. Using a model system of sessile marine invertebrates across 25\u00b0 latitude, from the temperate zone to the tropics, we test the prediction that spatial and temporal patterns of taxonomic richness and composition, and the community assembly processes underlying these patterns, will differ across latitude. Specifically, we predict that high beta diversity (spatial variation in composition) and high temporal turnover contribute to the high species richness of the tropics. Using a standardized experimental approach that controls for several confounding factors that hinder interpretation of prior studies, we present results that support our predictions. In the temperate zone, communities were more similar across spatial scales from centimeters to tens of kilometers and temporal scales up to one year than at lower latitudes. Since the patterns at northern latitudes were congruent with a null model, stochastic assembly processes are implicated. In contrast, the communities in the tropics were a dynamic spatial and temporal mosaic, with low similarity even across small spatial scales and high temporal turnover at both local and regional scales. Unlike the temperate zone, deterministic community assembly processes such as predation likely contributed to the high beta diversity in the tropics.

Comparison to other radiocarbon-dated pollen sequences from the Baikal region suggests that the chronology presented is very reliable and thus correlation to other dated events can easily be performed. Pollen indices, which reflect relative changes in major vegetation types and limitations of growing conditions by moisture availability and temperature, demonstrate near-synchronous vegetation changes, which suggest synchronous large-scale climate variation across the Baikal region. Due to the low level or even absence of human impact in the Lake Baikal region, the pollen data illustrate that in the continental interior of NE Eurasia Holocene climate variability was very pronounced. After initial warming and a strong increase in relative moisture (ca. 15-14.6 cal ka BP) the B\u00f6lling / Aller\u00f6d like event was punctuated by three cool and dry events. These events at approx. 14.2 ka BP, 13.8 ka BP and 13.2 cal ka BP can be compared to coolings as recorded in GISP 2 oxygen isotope records from Greenland ice cores. An expansion of Betula sect.Nane/Fruticosae, Artemisia and Chenopodiaceae marks the Younger Dryas-like cooling event (ca. 12.5-12 cal ka BP).High temperatures and favourable moisture conditions during the first part of Holocene favoured the optimum development of dark-coniferous taiga between 10-8 cal ka BP in the south and 9.0-7.5 cal ka in the northeast. A fir and spruce decline in the southern mountains (ca. 8-7 cal ka BP) can be related to the 8.2 cal ka BP cooling event. The pronounced mid-Holocene cooling event and a transition towards dry conditions (ca. 7.0-5.5 cal ka BP) preceded the nearly synchronous regional expansion of pine taiga.Maximum distribution of Scots pine forests marks the Holocene thermal optimum (ca. 6.5 -5.7 cal ka BP), which was followed by two subsequent cooling events (ca. 5.5-4.8 cal ka BP) at the Atlantic-Subboreal transition. A subsequent temperature optimum in the southeastern Baikal region ended with pronounced cooling during the Subboreal-Subatlantic transition (ca. 3-2.5 cal ka BP). A late spread of shrub alders may evidence the beginning of the Little Ice Age (ca. 0.8-0.3 ka BP).", "title": "Late glacial and Holocene vegetation and regional climate variability evidenced in high-resolution pollen records from Lake Baikal", "query": "Late glacial and Holocene vegetation and regional climate variability evidenced in high-resolution pollen records from Lake Baikal"}

However, since the mid-2000s during the so-called global warming hiatus, large amounts of heat were transferred in this basin from upper to deeper levels while the dominance in terms of atmospheric heat capture moved into the Indo-Pacific. Here we show that a large transformation of modal waters in the eastern North Atlantic (ENA) played a crucial role in such contrasting behavior. First, strong winter mixing in 2005 transformed ENA modal waters into a much saltier, warmer, and denser variety, transferring upper ocean heat and salt gained slowly over time to deeper layers. The new denser waters also altered the zonal dynamic height gradient reversing the southward regional flow and enhancing the access of saltier southern waters to higher latitudes. Then, the excess salinity in northern regions favored additional heat injection through deep convection events in later years.", "title": "Mid-2000s North Atlantic shift: Heat budget and circulation changes", "query": "Mid-2000s North Atlantic shift: Heat budget and circulation changes"}

Sea ice sediment inclusions were studied in the central Arctic Ocean during the Arctic 91 expedition and in the Laptev Sea (East Siberian Arctic Region Expedition 1992). Results from these investigations are here combined with previous studies performed in major areas of ice ablation and the southern central Arctic Ocean. This study documents the regional distribution and composition of particle-laden ice, investigates and evaluates processes by which sediment is incorporated into the ice cover, and identifies transport paths and probable depositional centers for the released sediment.In April 1992, sea ice in the Laptev Sea was relatively clean. The sediment occasionally observed was distributed diffusely over the entire ice column, forming turbid ice. Observations indicate that frazil and anchor ice formation occurring in a large coastal polynya provide a main mechanism for sediment entrainment. In the central Arctic Ocean sediments are concentrated in layers within or at the surface of ice floes due to melting and refreezing processes. The surface sediment accumulation in central Arctic multi-year sea ice exceeds by far the amounts observed in first-year ice from the Laptev Sea in April 1992.Sea ice sediments are generally fine grained, although coarse sediments and stones up to 5 cm in diameter are observed. Component analysis indicates that quartz and clay minerals are the main terrigenous sediment particles. The biogenous components, namely shells of pelecypods and benthic foraminiferal tests, point to a shallow, benthic, marine source area. Apparently, sediment inclusions were resuspended from shelf areas before and incorporated into the sea ice by suspension freezing.Clay mineralogy of ice-rafted sediments provides information on potential source areas. A smectite maximum in sea ice sediment samples repeatedly occurred between 81\u00b0N and 83\u00b0N along the Arctic 91 transect, indicating a rather stable and narrow smectite rich ice drift stream of the Transpolar Drift. The smectite concentrations are comparable to those found in both Laptev Sea shelf sediments and anchor ice sediments, pointing to this sea as a potential source area for sea ice sediments.In the central Arctic Ocean sea ice clay mineralogy is significantly different from deep-sea clay mineral distribution patterns. The contribution of sea ice sediments to the deep sea is apparently diluted by sedimentary material provided by other transport mechanisms.", "title": "Sediments in Arctic sea ice: Implications for entrainment,  transport and release", "query": "Sediments in Arctic sea ice: Implications for entrainment,  transport and release"}

Polarstern cruise ANT X/6, part of the international Southern Ocean JGOFS programme, investigated phytoplankton spring bloom development and its biogeochemical effects in different water masses of the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean: the Polar Frontal region (PFr), the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current zone (sACC), its boundary with the Weddell Gyre (AWB) and the marginal ice zone (MIZ). The relative roles of physical stability, iron limitation and grazing pressure in enhancing or constraining phytoplankton biomass accumulation were examined. Three sections were carried out between the PFr and the ice edge along the 6\\W meridian from early October to late November 1992. This paper summarises the major findings of the cruise and discusses their implications for our understanding of Southern Ocean ecology and biogeochemistry.A major finding was the negligible build-up of plankton biomass and concomitant absence of CO* drawdown associated with seasonal retreat of the ice cover. In striking contrast to this unexpected poverty of both the MIZ and the frontal region of the AWB, distinct phytoplankton blooms, dominated by different diatom species, accumulated in the PFr. Chlorophyll stocks in the sACC remained monotonously low throughout the study. Our findings confirm those of other studies that frontal regions are the major productive sites in the Southern Ocean and that input of meltwater and associated ice algae to the surface layer from a retreating ice edge is by itself an insufficient condition for induction of phytoplankton blooms. The blooms in the PFr developed under conditions of shallow mixing layers, high iron concentrations and relatively low grazing pressure. However, in all three blooms, high biomass extended to deeper than 70 m, which cannot be explained by either in situ growth or sinking out of a part of the population from the upper euphotic zone. Subduction of adjoining, shallower layers to explain depth distribution is invoked. Despite a clear CO1 drawdown in the Polar Frontal region, the highly variable conditions encountered render reliable estimation of annual CO2 fluxes in the Southern Ocean difficult.", "title": "Ecology and biogeochemistry of the antarctic circumpolar current during austral spring: a summary of southern ocean JGOFS cruise ANT X/6 of R.V.

It usually inhabits various low-oxygen habitats, burrows inside the mudflat, and sometimes \\walks\\ to search for suitable environments during summer. It has evolved accessory air-breathing organs for respiring air and corresponding mechanisms to survive in such challenging environments. Thereby, it serves as a great model for understanding adaptations to terrestrial life. Results: Comparative genomics with channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) revealed specific adaptations of C. batrachus in DNA repair, enzyme activator activity, and small GTPase regulator activity. Comparative analysis with 11 non-air-breathing fish species suggested adaptive evolution in gene expression and nitrogenous waste metabolic processes. Further, myoglobin, olfactory receptor related to class A G protein-coupled receptor 1, and sulfotransferase 6b1 genes were found to be expanded in the air-breathing walking catfish genome, with 15, 15, and 12 copies, respectively, compared to non-air-breathing fishes that possess only 1-2 copies of these genes. Additionally, we sequenced and compared the transcriptomes of the gill and the air-breathing organ to characterize the mechanism of aerial respiration involved in elastic fiber formation, oxygen binding and transport, angiogenesis, ion homeostasis and acid-base balance. The hemoglobin genes were expressed dramatically higher in the air-breathing organ than in the gill of walking catfish.Conclusions:This study provides an important genomic resource for understanding the adaptive mechanisms of walking catfish to terrestrial environments. It is possible that the coupling of enhanced abilities for oxygen storage and oxygen transport through genomic expansion of myoglobin genes and transcriptomic up-regulation of hemoglobin and angiogenesis-related genes are important components of the molecular basis for adaptation of this aquatic species to terrestrial life.", "title": "Genome sequence of walking catfish (Clarias batrachus) provides insights into terrestrial adaptation", "query": "Genome sequence of walking catfish (Clarias batrachus) provides insights into terrestrial adaptation"}

Increasing demand and consumption from a growing global population are driving further expansion of both inland and marine aquaculture (i.e., mariculture, including marine species farmed on land). However, the growth of mariculture is dependent on the availability of suitable farming areas for new facilities, particularly for open farming practices that rely on the natural oceanic environmental parameters such as temperature, oxygen, chlorophyll etc. In this study, we estimated the marine areas within the exclusive economic zones of all countries that were suitable for potential open ocean mariculture activities. To this end, we quantify the environmental niche and inferred the global habitat suitability index (HSI) of the 102 most farmed marine species using four species distribution models. The average weighted HSI across the four models suggests that 72,000,000 km 2 of ocean are to be environmentally suitable to farm one or more species.

Suitable mariculture areas along the Atlantic coast of South America and West Africa appear to be most under-utilized for farming.

The updated data set spans the 1993-2012 period and consists of drifter velocities, altimetry data, hydrological profiles and model data. The methodology is similar to the previous MDT by Rio et al.

A number of sensitivity studies have been carried out to obtain the most accurate MDT as possible. The main results from these sensitivity studies are the following: moderate impact to the choice of correlation scales but almost negligible sensitivity to the choice of the first guess (model solution). A systematic external validation to independent data has been made to evaluate the performance of the new MDT.

Both cloud cases exhibited the typical vertical mixed-phase structure with mostly liquid water droplets at cloud top and ice crystals in lower layers. The horizontal, small-scale distribution of the thermodynamic phase as observed during the cold air outbreak is dominated by the liquid water close to the cloud top and shows no indication of ice in lower cloud layers. Contrastingly, the cloud top variability in the case observed during a warm air advection showed some ice in areas of low reflectivity or cloud holes. Radiative transfer simulations considering homogeneous mixtures of liquid water droplets and ice crystals were able to reproduce the horizontal variability in this warm air advection. Large eddy simulations (LESs) were performed to reconstruct the observed cloud properties, which were used subsequently as input for radiative transfer simulations. The LESs of the cloud case observed during the cold air outbreak, with mostly liquid water at cloud top, realistically reproduced the observations. For the warm air advection case, the simulated ice water content (IWC) was systematically lower than the measured IWC. Nevertheless, the LESs revealed the presence of ice particles close to the cloud top and confirmed the observed horizontal variability in the cloud field. It is concluded that the cloud top smallscale horizontal variability is directly linked to changes in the vertical distribution of the cloud thermodynamic phase.

We investigate potential drivers of this mis-match aggregating to sub-basin regions and find that the steric plus GRACE ocean mass observations do not represent the small-scale features seen in the satellite altimetry.

Future projections of carbonate production in the Southern Ocean are challenging due to the lack of historical data collection and complex, decadal climate variability. Here we present a 6-yearlong record of the shell fluxes, morphology and stable isotope variability of the polar planktic foraminifera Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (sensu stricto) from near Palmer Station, Antarctica. This species is fundamental to Southern Ocean planktic carbonate production as it is one of the very few planktic foraminifer species adapted to the marine polar en-vironments. We use these new data to obtain insights into its ecology and to derive a robust assessment of the response of this polar species to environmental change. Morphology and stable isotope composition reveal the presence of different growth stages within this tightly defined species. Inter-and intra-annual variability of foraminiferal flux and size is evident and driven by a combination of environmental forcing parameters, most importantly food availability, temperature and sea ice duration and extent. Foraminiferal growth occurs throughout the austral year and is influenced by environmental change, a large portion of which is driven by the Southern Annular Mode and El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation.

Trends over the past 2700 years in RICE are shown to be distinct from those in West Antarctica and the western Ross Sea captured by other ice cores. For most of this interval, the eastern Ross Sea was warming (or showing isotopic enrichment for other reasons), with increased snow accumulation and perhaps decreased sea ice concentration. However, West Antarctica cooled and the western Ross Sea showed no significant isotope temperature trend. This pattern here is referred to as the Ross Sea Dipole. Notably, during the Little Ice Age, West Antarctica and the western Ross Sea experienced colder than average temperatures, while the eastern Ross Sea underwent a period of warming or increased isotopic enrichment. From the 17th century onwards, this dipole relationship changed. All three regions show current warming, with snow accumulation declining in West Antarctica and the eastern Ross Sea but increasing in the western Ross Sea. We interpret this pattern as reflecting an increase in sea ice in the eastern Ross Sea with perhaps the establishment of a modern Roosevelt Island polynya as a local moisture source for RICE.

At a local scale however, biological activity of macrophytes may generate pH fluctuations with rates of change that are orders of magnitude larger than the long-term trend predicted for the open ocean. These fluctuations may in turn impact benthic calcifiers in the vicinity. Combining laboratory, mesocosm and field studies, such interactions between OA, the brown alga Fucus vesiculosus, the sea grass Zostera marina and the blue mussel Mytilus edulis were investigated at spatial scales from decimetres to 100s of meters in the western Baltic. Macrophytes increased the overall mean pH of the habitat by up to 0.3 units relative to macrophyte-free, but otherwise similar, habitats and imposed diurnal pH fluctuations with amplitudes ranging from 0.3 to more than 1 pH unit. These amplitudes and their impact on mussel calcification tended to increase with increasing macrophyte biomass to bulk water ratio. At the laboratory and mesocosm scales, biogenic pH fluctuations allowed mussels to maintain calcification even under acidified conditions by shifting most of their calcification activity into the daytime when biogenic fluctuations caused by macrophyte activity offered temporal refuge from OA stress. In natural habitats with a low biomass to water body ratio, the impact of biogenic pH fluctuations on mean calcification rates of M. edulis was less pronounced. Thus, in dense algae or seagrass habitats, macrophytes may mitigate OA impact on mussel calcification by raising mean pH and providing temporal refuge from acidification stress.", "title": "Macroalgae may mitigate ocean acidification effects on mussel calcification by increasing pH and its fluctuations", "query": "Macroalgae may mitigate ocean acidification effects on mussel calcification by increasing pH and its fluctuations"}

However, we observed high zz'Pa/ 230Th ratios, conventionally interpreted as a high-productivity signal, in surface sediments south of the Polar Front, especially throughout the Weddell Sea, in contradiction with the low particle flux of this region.

This observation clearly indicates that the high Ez'Pa/ '30Th ratios in surface sediments south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current are produced by a N-S increase in the relative scavenging efficiency of 23'Pa relative to 230 Th, most probably due to a change in the chemical composition of particulate matter, and not by a high mass flux. It is speculated that biogenic opal, suggested not to significantly fractionate 23'Pa and 13'Th, may explain the enhanced scavenging of 23' Pa to the south. This assumption is further supported by extremely high 23' Pa/ 230Th ratios up to 0.34 in material collected with sediment traps south of the Polar Front, where fluxes are primarily determined by biogenic opal.

Until now the source area (catchment area) of trapped particles is unclear; however, lateral advection of particles is supposed to play an important role.

Our study shows that the extent of the catchment area is larger the deeper the trap and the slower the settling velocity. Chlorophyll-a concentration as well as sea ice coverage of the catchment area are highest in the summer months. The high sea ice coverage in summer compared to winter can possibly be related to a weaker across-strait sea level pressure difference, which allows more sea ice to enter the then well-strati\ufb01ed central Fram Strait where the moorings are located. Furthermore, a backward sea ice tracking approach shows that the origin and age of sea ice drifting through Fram Strait, partly responsible for vertical particle \ufb02uxes, varies strongly from year to year, pointing to a high variability in the composition of particles trapped in the moorings.", "title": "Origin and properties of sediment trap catchment areas in Fram Strait: results from Lagrangian modelling and remote sensing", "query": "Origin and properties of sediment trap catchment areas in Fram Strait: results from Lagrangian modelling and remote sensing"}

Notwithstanding the advanced state-of-the-art modeling of food webs in the region, no previous studies have projected the consequences of climate change on marine ecosystems in an integrated way, considering changes in ocean dynamics, in phyto- and zoo-plankton productions, shifts in Mediterranean species distributions and their trophic interactions at the whole basin scale. We used an integrated modeling chain including a high-resolution regional climate model, a regional biogeochemistry model and a food web model OSMOSE to project the potential effects of climate change on biomass and catches for a wide array of species in the Mediterranean Sea. We showed that projected climate change would have large consequences for marine biodiversity by the end of the 21st century under a business-as-usual scenario (RCP8.5 with current \ufb01shing mortality).

Combining minimum bottom salinity, annual primary production range, fishing effort and biomass of sponges and small gorgonian corals, resulted in the best performing generalized additive model, explaining 73% of the total variance in SpD.

Vegetation cover became denser about 42.5-33.5 kyr BP, reflecting more favorable climate conditions. Scarce Poaceae communities with some Caryophyllaceae, Asteraceae, Cichoriaceae, and Selaginella rupestris covered the Bykovsky Peninsula area during the Sartan (Late Weichselian) stage about 26-16 kyr BP. Disturbed, uncovered soils were very common in the area. Climate was extremely cold and dry. Poaceae and Cyperaceae associations with Caryophyllaceae, Asteraceae, Cichoriaceae dominated the vegetation in the late Sartan, ca 16-12.2 kyr BP.

It is likely that projected ocean acidification levels will aggravate coral reef health. We first investigated how ocean acidification interacts with one near shore locally abundant metal on the physiology of two major reef-building corals: Stylophora pistillata and Acropora muricata. Two pH levels (pH T 8.02; pCO 2 366 \u03bcatm and pH T 7.75; pCO 2 1140 \u03bcatm) and two cobalt concentrations (natural, 0.03 \u03bcg L -1 and polluted, 0.2 \u03bcg L -1 ) were tested during five weeks in aquaria. We found that, for both species, cobalt input decreased significantly their growth rates by 28% while it stimulated their photosystem II, with higher values of rETR max (relative Electron Transport Rate). Elevated pCO 2 levels acted differently on the coral rETR max values and did not affect their growth rates. No consistent interaction was found between pCO 2 levels and cobalt concentrations. We also measured in situ the effect of higher cobalt concentrations (1.06 \u00b1 0.16 \u03bcg L -1 ) on A. muricata using benthic chamber experiments. At this elevated concentration, cobalt decreased simultaneously coral growth and photosynthetic rates, indicating that the toxic threshold for this pollutant has been reached for both host cells and zooxanthellae. Our results from both aquaria and in situ experiments, suggest that these coral species are not particularly sensitive to high pCO 2 conditions but they are to ecologically relevant cobalt concentrations. Our study reveals that some reefs may be yet subjected to deleterious pollution levels, and even if no interaction between pCO 2 levels and cobalt concentration has been found, it is likely that coral metabolism will be weakened if they are subjected to additional threats such as temperature increase, other heavy metals, and eutrophication.", "title": "Responses of Two Scleractinian Corals to Cobalt Pollution and Ocean Acidification", "query": "Responses of Two Scleractinian Corals to Cobalt Pollution and Ocean Acidification"}

The Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP) is responsible for around 10% of global ocean productivity, largely due to wind-driven seasonal upwelling areas between Mexico and Panama. The Gulf of Panama has a detectable outflow for hundreds of kilometres into the Pacific Ocean and the upwelling system there is an important productivity source in the TEP. In this study, we aim to determine the spatio-temporal patterns in variability of carbon and nitrogen stable isotope composition throughout the pelagic ecosystem of the Bay of Panama in upwelling and non-upwelling conditions, and how these patterns are recorded throughout the ecosystem from primary producers to apex predators. We characterise the stable isotope composition of basal production in the ecosystem to quantify spatial variability during the non-upwelling season. We use the \u03b415N composition outside of upwelling season as an ecosystem baseline and quantify the overall \u03b415N separation between all trophic levels (TL) from primary producers to apex predators (e.g. yellowfin tuna and mahi mahi) within the pelagic ecosystem (2.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.1\u2030 per TL). The ecosystem has a relatively simple, linear structure with size-based TL increase. We calculate the predator-prey mass ratio of this ecosystem (c. 113:1 for fishes, 376:1 for the whole ecosystem, uncertainty range: 77:1\u20131272:1). These values are low for existing estimates in other marine ecosystems, although within the expected range for animals of the mass sampled. The calculated predator-prey mass ratios and maximum TL indicate that this pelagic ecosystem may have a relatively long trophic chain, with inefficient nutrient transfer from low to high TLs.  Using a monthly time series of stable isotope values of resident, planktivorous fishes and co-occurring sea surface temperature measurements, we determine nutrient transfer time between primary production and TL3 fish. We calculate a rapid nutrient turnover time within this ecosystem as 0.5\u20131\u202fmonth per TL. The incorporation of upwelled nutrients, which are enriched in the 13C, leads to higher consumer \u03b413C values. Carbon isotopes can therefore be used to track timing, duration, and use of upwelling zones. Our findings give novel, empirical insights into the functional ecology of the pelagic ecosystem in the Gulf of Panama, and provide a baseline for comparison and quantification of ecosystem structure and dynamics in the tropics, and in other pelagic upwelling systems.", "title": "Structure and nutrient transfer in a tropical pelagic upwelling food web: From isoscapes to the whole ecosystem", "query": "Structure and nutrient transfer in a tropical pelagic upwelling food web: From isoscapes to the whole ecosystem"}

Even though the deep sea is generally considered to be a stable environment, it can be dynamic and vulnerable to anthropogenic disturbances including increasing temperature, deoxygenation, ocean acidification and pollution. Lophelia pertusa is among the better-studied cold-water corals but was only recently documented along the US West Coast, growing in acidified conditions. In the present study, coral fragments were collected at \u223c300 m depth along the southern California margin and kept in recirculating tanks simulating conditions normally found in the natural environment for this species. At the collection site, waters exhibited persistently low pH and aragonite saturation states ( arag ) with average values for pH of 7.66 \u00b1 0.01 and arag of 0.81 \u00b1 0.07. In the laboratory, fragments were grown for three weeks in ''favorable'' pH/ arag of 7.9/1.47 (aragonite saturated) and ''unfavorable'' pH/ arag of 7.6/0.84 (aragonite undersaturated) conditions.

It is known that retroviruses and other retro-transcribing viruses evolve from LTR retrotransposons and that this whole system clusters into five families: Ty3/Gypsy, Retroviridae, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao and Caulimoviridae. Phylogenetic analyses usually show that these split into multiple distinct lineages but what is yet to be understood is how deep evolution occurred in this system.Results:We combined phylogenetic and graph analyses to investigate the history of LTR retroelements both as a tree and as a network. We used 268 non-redundant LTR retroelements, many of them introduced for the first time in this work, to elucidate all possible LTR retroelement phylogenetic patterns. These were superimposed over the tree of eukaryotes to investigate the dynamics of the system, at distinct evolutionary times. Next, we investigated phenotypic features such as duplication and variability of amino acid motifs, and several differences in genomic ORF organization. Using this information we characterized eight reticulate evolution markers to construct phenotypic network models.Conclusion:The evolutionary history of LTR retroelements can be traced as a time-evolving network that depends on phylogenetic patterns, epigenetic host-factors and phenotypic plasticity. The Ty1/Copia and the Ty3/Gypsy families represent the oldest patterns in this network that we found mimics eukaryotic macroevolution. The emergence of the Bel/Pao, Retroviridae and Caulimoviridae families in this network can be related with distinct inflations of the Ty3/Gypsy family, at distinct evolutionary times. This suggests that Ty3/Gypsy ancestors diversified much more than their Ty1/Copia counterparts, at distinct geological eras. Consistent with the principle of preferential attachment, the connectivities among phenotypic markers, taken as network-represented combinations, are power-law distributed. This evidences an inflationary mode of evolution where the system diversity; 1) expands continuously alternating vertical and gradual processes of phylogenetic divergence with episodes of modular, saltatory and reticulate evolution; 2) is governed by the intrinsic capability of distinct LTR retroelement host-communities to self-organize their phenotypes according to emergent laws characteristic of complex systems.Reviewers: This article was reviewed by Eugene V.

Population characteristics such as phenotypic plasticity and beneficial life history traits may facilitate successful transition of species through different stages of the process; however, studies on the latter are not so common and most of those studies focus on terrestrial taxa. In this study, we hypothesized seven life history traits that may be beneficial for invasion success of aquatic species, and determined those traits for established non-indigenous species (NIS) in the North and Baltic Seas (i.e. marine environment) and Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River regions (i.e. freshwater environment). This is the first study that examined certain life history traits of all NIS established in particular regions, as well as compared those traits between marine and freshwater habitats. Our study determined some differences in life history traits between NIS in the marine and freshwater habitats. Those differences were connected to different taxonomic groups that were dominant NIS in these two types of habitats. Furthermore, species originating from different donor regions had also different life history traits. The majority of NIS in both regions were r-strategists. There was a significantly higher number of NIS that were able to reproduce both asexually and sexually and to produce dormant stages in the freshwater than in marine habitat. Finally, as r-strategy, asexual reproduction and dormancy were dominant traits of NIS in the freshwater habitat, freshwater ecosystems may be under greater invasion risk than marine ones, as those traits reduce both demographic and environmental stochasticity during the invasion process.", "title": "Life history traits of aquatic non-indigenous species: freshwater vs. marine habitats", "query": "Life history traits of aquatic non-indigenous species: freshwater vs. marine habitats"}

Still, seabed methane emissions contribute to the global carbon budget, and understanding such processes is critical to constrain future quantifications of seabed methane release at local and global scales.

All data sets suggest that the pockmark is composed of two very distinctive zones in terms of seepage intensity. We postulate that these zones are the surface expression of two fluid flow regimes in the subsurface: focused flow through a fractured medium and diffuse flow through a porous medium. We conclude that the growth of giant pockmarks is controlled by self-sealing processes and lateral spreading of rising fluids.

Such changes have been shown to slow down calcification in corals and coralline macroalgae5,6, but the majority of marine calcification occurs in planktonic organisms. Here we report reduced calcite production at increased CO2 concentrations in monospecific cultures of two dominant marine calcifying phytoplankton species, the coccolithophorids Emiliania huxleyi and Gephyrocapsa oceanica . This was accompanied by an increased proportion of malformed coccoliths and incomplete coccospheres. Diminished calcification led to a reduction in the ratio of calcite precipitation to organic matter production. Similar results were obtained in incubations of natural plankton assemblages from the north Pacific ocean when exposed to experimentally elevated CO2 levels. We suggest that the progressive increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations may therefore slow down the production of calcium carbonate in the surface ocean.

Shoreline positions were acquired from aerial and satellite images between 1951 and 2011. Shoreline change rates were calculated for multiple time periods along the entire coast and at six key sites. Additionally, Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) measurements of shoreline positions from seven field sites were used to analyze coastal dynamics from 1991 to 2015 at higher spatial resolution. The whole coast has a consistent, spatially averaged mean rate of shoreline change of 0.7 \u00b1 0.2 m/a with a general trend of decreasing erosion from west to east. Additional data from six key sites shows that the mean shoreline change rate decreased from \u00c01.3 \u00b1 0.8 (1950s-1970s) to \u00c00.5 \u00b1 0.6 m/a (1970s-1990s). This was followed by a significant increase in shoreline change to \u00c01.3 \u00b1 0.3 m/a in the 1990s to 2011. This increase is confirmed by DGPS measurements that indicate increased erosion rates at local rates up to \u00c08.9 m/a since 2006.

To better understand the reaction of Arctic coasts to increasing environmental pressure, shoreline position changes along a 210-km length of the Yukon Territory coast in northwest Canada were investigated for the time period from 1951 to 2015. Shoreline positions were extracted from historical aerial images from the 1950s, 1970s, and 1990s and from satellite images from 2011. Additionally, measurements of shoreline positions from field sites were used to analyze coastal dynamics from 1991 to 2015. The mean shoreline change rate was \u00c01.3 m/a between the 1950s and 1970s and followed by a decrease to \u00c00.5 m/a between the 1970s to 1990s. This was followed by a significant increase in mean shoreline change rates again to \u00c01.3 m/a in the 1990s to 2011 time period. This acceleration in erosion is confirmed by field measurements that indicate increased erosion rates at high local rates up to \u00c08.9 m/a since 2006. Enhanced coastal erosion might, in turn, favor the buildup of gravel features, which have been growing in extent throughout the last six decades.", "title": "Variability in Rates of Coastal Change Along the Yukon Coast, 1951 to 2015", "query": "Variability in Rates of Coastal Change Along the Yukon Coast, 1951 to 2015"}

Deep water cannot be exchanged across the ridge, and only limited water mass exchange in intermediate layers is possible through deep channels, where the flow is directed southwestward (the Nordic Overflows). As a result, the near-bottom water masses in the deep basins of the northern North Atlantic and the Nordic Seas hold major temperature differences.Here, we use near-bottom measurements of about 88,000 CTD (conductivity-temperature-depth) and bottle profiles, collected in the period 1900-2008, to investigate the distribution of near-bottom properties. Data are gridded into regular boxes of about 11 km size and interpolated following isobaths. We derive average spatial temperature and salinity distributions in the region around Iceland, showing the influence of the GSR on the near-bottom hydrography. The spatial distribution of standard deviation is used to identify local variability, which is enhanced near water mass fronts.Finally, property changes within the period 1975-2008 are presented using time series analysis techniques for a collection of grid boxes with sufficient data resolution. Seasonal variability, as well as long term trends are discussed for different bottom depth classes, representing varying water masses. The seasonal cycle is most pronounced in temperature and decreases with depth (mean amplitudes of 2.2 \u00b0C in the near surface layers vs. 0.2 \u00b0C at depths >500 m), while linear trends are evident in both temperature and salinity (maxima in shallow waters of \u00fe0.33 \u00b0C/decade for temperature and \u00fe 0.03/ decade for salinity).", "title": "Bottom temperature and salinity distribution and its variability around Iceland", "query": "Bottom temperature and salinity distribution and its variability around Iceland"}

Morphology and geochemistry were compared between colonies from normal (mean pH = 8.07, min. pH 7.95), below-normal (mean pH 7.66, min. pH 7.32) and acidic (mean pH 7.43, min. pH 6.83) conditions after colonies had been exposed in situ for 45 and 128 days. Both distal (juvenile) and proximal (adult) parts of the branches were investigated. Skeletons of live colonies in acidic pH site after 45 days of exposure were less corroded than those of dead colonies, suggesting that the organic tissues enveloping the skeleton play a protective role. Colonies remained alive at the below-normal and acidic pH sites during the 45-day experiment but corrosion was very striking after 128 days, with colonies from the acidic site showing significant loss of skeleton. Compared to the control, these colonies also had lower levels of Mg (mean 8 versus 9.5 wt% Mg) within their skeletons. Electron microprobe mapping showed Mg to be higher in the outer layers of the skeletal walls in colonies from the normal pH site. Corrosion of outer layers of the walls probably explains the lower Mg level found in colonies exposed to acidic conditions. As solubility of calcite increases with Mg content, the enrichment of Mg in outer layers of the skeleton should enhance the vulnerability of Myriapora truncata to dissolution. These findings raise concerns over the survival of bryozoans with Mg calcite skeletons in the face of predicted decreases in oceanic pH levels.", "title": "Structural and geochemical alterations in the Mg calcite bryozoan Myriapora truncata under elevated seawater pCO2 simulating ocean acidification", "query": "Structural and geochemical alterations in the Mg calcite bryozoan Myriapora truncata under elevated seawater pCO2 simulating ocean acidification"}

One frequently discussed reason is that the restored river length is insufficient to allow populations to develop and give the room for geomorphological processes to occur. We investigated ten pairs of restored river sections of which one was a large project involving a long, intensively restored river section and one represented a smaller restoration effort. The restoration effect was quantified by comparing each restored river section to an upstream non-restored section. We sampled the following response variables: habitat composition in the river and its floodplain, three aquatic organism groups (aquatic macrophytes, benthic invertebrates and fish), two floodplain-inhabiting organism groups (floodplain vegetation, ground beetles), as well as food web composition and land-water interactions reflected by stable isotopes. For each response variable, we compared the difference in dissimilarity of the restored and nearby non-restored section between the larger and the smaller restoration projects. In a second step, we regrouped the pairs and compared restored sections with large changes in substrate composition to those with small changes. When comparing all restored to all non-restored sections, ground beetles were most strongly responding to restoration, followed by fish, floodplain vegetation, benthic invertebrates and aquatic macrophytes. Aquatic habitats and stable isotope signatures responded less strongly. When grouping the restored sections by project size, there was no difference in the response to restoration between the projects targeting long and short river sections with regard to any of the measured response variables except nitrogen isotopic composition. In contrast, when grouping the restored sections by substrate composition, the responses of fish, benthic invertebrates, aquatic macrophytes, floodplain vegetation and nitrogen isotopic composition were greater in sections with larger changes in substrate composition as compared to those with smaller changes.Synthesis and applications. The effects of hydromorphological restoration measures on aquatic and floodplain biota strongly depend on the creation of habitat for aquatic organisms, which were limited or not present prior to restoration. These positive effects on habitats are not necessarily related to the restored river length. Therefore, we recommend a focus on habitat enhancement in river restoration projects.The effects of hydromorphological restoration measures on aquatic and floodplain biota strongly depend on the creation of habitat for aquatic organisms, which were limited or not present prior to restoration.

The Nested Environmental status Assessment Tool (NEAT), developed for the integrated assessment of the status of marine waters, was applied to 10 marine ecosystems to test its applicability and compare biodiversity assessments across the four European regional seas.

No strong pattern among the ecosystem components across the case study areas could be detected, but marine mammals, birds, and benthic vegetation indicators tended to indicate poor status while zooplankton indicators indicated good status when included into the assessment.

Current understanding of upper-ocean mixing is lacking, often leading models to misrepresent mixed-layer depths and sea surface temperature. In part, progress has been limited due to the difficulty of measuring turbulence from fixed moorings which can simultaneously measure surface fluxes and upper-ocean stratification over long time periods. Here we introduce a direct wavenumber method for measuring Turbulent Kinetic Energy (TKE) dissipation rates, \u03f5, from long-enduring moorings using pulse-coherent ADCPs. We discuss optimal programming of the ADCPs, a robust mechanical design for use on a mooring to maximize data return, and data processing techniques including phase-ambiguity unwrapping, spectral analysis, and a correction for instrument response. The method was used in the Salinity Processes Upper-ocean Regional Study (SPURS) to collect two year-long data sets.

The extreme buoyancy loss triggered the mixed layer to reach unprecedented depths affecting directly the level of local modal waters that are usually unconnected to air-sea interaction. The water column just below the climatological average mixed layer entered in a process of quick cooling that compensated in 2 years the 0.5\u00b0C gained in the period 1994-2004.

This low-nutrient low-chlorophyll 38 region is characterised by a long stratification period (May-November) during which 39 surface waters are depleted of macronutrients. Trace metals exhibit a range of 40 biogeochemical behaviours from surface-enriched (scavenged-type) to surface-depleted 41 (nutrient-like) with Co and Ni as representative cases. Cobalt (28 - 172 pM) distributions 42 are governed by external inputs of aeolian dust deposition and removal by adsorption 43 onto particles in surface, intermediate and deep waters as well. Nickel (3.57 - 5.52 nM) 44 distributions are governed by internal biogeochemical cycles, together with physical 45 mixing and circulation patterns. Nickel is primarily removed from surface waters with 46 biogenic particles and then remineralised at depth.

Using proxy-based modeling of three trophic levels (algae, herbivores, and fish), we show that asynchronous changes in phenology only occur if warming is seasonally heterogeneous, but not if warming is constant throughout the year. If warming is seasonally heterogeneous, the degree and even direction of asynchrony depends on the specific seasonality of the warming. Conclusions about phenological mismatches in food web interactions may therefore produce controversial results if the analyses do not distinguish between seasonally constant and seasonal specific warming.

Two passages form the gate- ways for warm and saline Atlantic Water to the Arctic: the shallow Barents Sea and the Fram Strait which is the only deep connection between the Arctic and the World Ocean. The flows through both passages rejoin in the northern Kara Sea and continue in a boundary current along the Arctic Basin rim and ridges (Aagaard 1989; Rudels et al. 1994). In the Arctic, dramatic water mass conversions take place and the warm and saline Atlantic Water is modified by cooling, freezing and melting as well as by admixture of river run-off to become shallow Polar Water, ice and saline deep water. The return flow of these waters to the south through the Fram Strait and the Canadian Archipelago closes the Atlantic Water loop through the Arctic.

Global surface air, upper North Atlantic Waters and Arctic intermediate waters showed coherently high temperatures in the middle of the last century and also in the past decades (Polyakov et al. 2003; Polyakov et al. 2004; Delworth and Knutson 2000).

Each fish underwent an incremental swim test to determine gait transition speed (U GT ), where it first engaged the unsteady anaerobic swimming mode that preceded fatigue. After suitable recovery, each fish was exercised at 85% of their own U GT and warmed 1\u00b0C every 30 min, to identify the temperature at which they fatigued, denoted as CT swim . Fish were also submitted to a standard CT max , warming at the same rate as CT swim , under static conditions until LOE.

Therefore, if exposed to acute warming in the wild, the ability to perform aerobic metabolic work would be constrained at temperatures significantly below those that directly threatened survival. The collapse in performance at CT swim was preceded by a gait transition qualitatively indistinguishable from that during the incremental swim test. This suggests that fatigue in CT swim was linked to an inability to meet the tissue oxygen demands of exercise plus warming. This is consistent with the oxygen and capacity limited thermal tolerance (OCLTT) hypothesis, regarding the mechanism underlying tolerance of warming in fishes.

We then examined how the relative contribution of these components changes with increased regional diversity. By employing specific random-placement null models, we overcome methodological problems with local-regional regressions. We show that, although alpha and beta diversities within each region are consistently different from random-placement null models, the increase in beta diversities among regions was similar to that predicted once heterogeneity in coral habitat was accounted for. In contrast, alpha diversity within single coral heads was limited and increased less than predicted by the null models. This was correlated with increased intraspecific aggregation in more diverse regions and is consistent with ecological limitations on the number of coexisting species at the local scale.

When normal conditions returned, warm-water ephemerals declined, crab densities rose, and grazers had significant but site-specific effects on algae. At one site, any combination of grazers diminished most erect species, reducing diversity and restoring dominance of competitively inferior grazer-resistant crusts. At a second site, only the combined effect of all grazers had this effect. Laboratory experiments confirmed that crabs could control erect algae and promote crustose forms, and crustose Gymnogongrus developed into an erect form in the absence of crabs. Differences between sites and large-scale temporal changes associated with El Nin \u02dco indicate that tropical shores are not all as constant in time and space as previously suggested. Mobile grazers did affect algal communities, but over the period of our observations far greater effects were attributable to intersite differences and temporal shifts in oceanographic conditions. El Nin \u02dco events reduce nutrients, intensify wave action, and raise sea levels, affecting food availability for intertidal herbivores and their influence on benthic algae. Thus, the dramatic transformations of communities during El Nin \u02dco presage the impacts of global climate change.", "title": "TOP-DOWN HERBIVORY AND BOTTOM-UP EL NIN\u0303O EFFECTS ON GAL\u00c1PAGOS ROCKY-SHORE COMMUNITIES", "query": "TOP-DOWN HERBIVORY AND BOTTOM-UP EL NIN\u0303O EFFECTS ON GAL\u00c1PAGOS ROCKY-SHORE COMMUNITIES"}

Fundamental to the EC approach is the correlation of turbulent velocity and oxygen concentration fluctuations measured with high frequencies in the same sampling volume. Oxygen concentrations are commonly measured with fast responding electrochemical microsensors. However, due to their own oxygen consumption, electrochemical microsensors are sensitive to changes of the diffusive boundary layer surrounding the probe and thus to changes in the ambient flow velocity. The so-called stirring sensitivity of microsensors constitutes an inherent correlation of flow velocity and oxygen sensing and thus an artificial flux which can confound the benthic flux determination. To assess the artificial flux we measured the correlation between the turbulent flow velocity and the signal of oxygen microsensors in a sealed annular flume without any oxygen sinks and sources. Experiments revealed significant correlations, even for sensors designed to have low stirring sensitivities of ~0.7%. The artificial fluxes depended on ambient flow conditions and, counter intuitively, increased at higher velocities because of the nonlinear contribution of turbulent velocity fluctuations. The measured artificial fluxes ranged from 2 -70 mmol m -2 d -1 for weak and very strong turbulent flow, respectively. Further, the stirring sensitivity depended on the sensor orientation towards the flow. For a sensor orientation typically used in field studies, the artificial flux could be predicted using a simplified mathematical model. Optical microsensors (optodes) that should not exhibit a stirring sensitivity were tested in parallel and did not show any significant correlation between O 2 signals and turbulent flow.

We investigate the Karoo Basin, taking into account host-rock material properties from borehole data, realistic total organic carbon content, and different sill geometries. Consistent with geological observations, we find that thermal plumes quickly rise at the edges of saucer-shaped sills, guided along vertically fractured high-permeability pathways. Contrastingly, less focused and slower plumes rise from the edges and the central part of flat-lying sills. Using a novel upscaling method based on sill-to-sediment ratio, we find that degassing of the Karoo Basin occurred in two distinct phases during magma invasion. Rapid degassing triggered by sills emplaced within the top 1.5 km emitted ~1.6\u202210 3 Gt of thermogenic methane, while thermal plumes originating from deeper sills, carrying a 13-times-greater mass of methane, may not reach the surface.

However, the key drivers in plankton communities controlling SV and C remin are poorly constrained. In fall 2014, we conducted a 6-week mesocosm experiment in the subtropical NE Atlantic Ocean to study the influence of plankton community structure on SV and C remin . Oligotrophic conditions prevailed for the first 3 weeks, until nutrient-rich deep water injected into all mesocosms stimulated diatom blooms. SV declined steadily over the course of the experiment due to decreasing CaCO 3 ballast and-according to an optical proxy proposed herein-due to increasing aggregate porosity mostly during an aggregation event after the diatom bloom. Furthermore, SV was positively correlated with the contribution of picophytoplankton to the total phytoplankton biomass. C remin was highest during a Synechococcus bloom under oligotrophic conditions and in some mesocosms during the diatom bloom after the deep water addition, while it was particularly low during harmful algal blooms. The temporal changes were considerably larger in C remin (max. fifteenfold) than in SV (max. threefold). Accordingly, estimated POC transfer efficiency to 1,000 m was mainly dependent on how the plankton community structure affected C remin .

Simulated interannual SSS variations compare favorably with both in situ and satellite data and are largest in boreal fall in three regions: the northern BoB, the coastal region off east India, and the Andaman Sea. In the northern BoB, these variations are independent from those in other regions and mostly driven by summer-fall Ganga-Brahmaputra runoff interannual variations. In fall, remote forcing from the Indian Ocean Dipole results in anticlockwise anomalous horizontal currents that drive interannual SSS variations of opposite polarity along the east coast of India and in the Southern Andaman Sea. From winter onward, these anomalies are damped by vertical mixing in the northern BoB and along the east coast of India and by horizontal advection in the Southern Andaman Sea.

Collectively, decreased grazing by L. vincta coupled with enhanced growth of S. latissima under elevated pCO 2 demonstrates that increased CO 2 associated with climate change and/or coastal processes will dually benefit commercially and ecologically important kelps by both promoting growth and reducing grazing pressure.", "title": "Dual benefit of ocean acidification for the laminarialean kelp Saccharina latissima: enhanced growth and reduced herbivory", "query": "Dual benefit of ocean acidification for the laminarialean kelp Saccharina latissima: enhanced growth and reduced herbivory"}

Hybrid paternity confirmation is therefore important for assuring germplasm origin, and is typically carried out by molecular marker segregation. The aim of this study was to karyotypically characterize the chromosome heritance patterns of the progeny resultant from a cross of P. gardneri and P. gibertii using classical cytogenetics, chromosome banding, and molecular cytogenetics. Results: All analyzed genotypes showed the same diploid chromosome number as the genitor species: 2n = 18. Classical and CMA 3 and DAPI staining allowed for chromosome counting and satellite identification (secondary constrictions). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) were used to characterize subgenomes by either identifying rDNA-specific genome patterns or parental genomes, respectively. Conclusions: The heritance of chromosomal markers presenting rDNA sites from each parent for genome identification confirmed that all obtained plants were hybrids. These results will improve breeding programs involving the species of this genus. Apart from confirming hybridization, GISH allowed the visualization of recombination between the homeologous chromosome and the introgression of sequences of interest.", "title": "Identification and characterization of karyotype in Passiflora hybrids using FISH and GISH", "query": "Identification and characterization of karyotype in Passiflora hybrids using FISH and GISH"}

They biochemically dissolve part of the carbonate and liberate so-called sponge chips, a process that is expected to be facilitated and accelerated in a more acidic environment inherent to the present global change. The bioerosion capacity of the demosponge Cliona celata Grant, 1826 in subfossil oyster shells was assessed via alkalinity anomaly technique based on 4 days of experimental exposure to three different levels of carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO 2 ) at ambient temperature in the coldtemperate waters of Helgoland Island, North Sea. The rate of chemical bioerosion at present-day pCO 2 was quantified with 0.08-0.1 kg m -2 year -1 . Chemical bioerosion was positively correlated with increasing pCO 2 , with rates more than doubling at carbon dioxide levels predicted for the end of the twenty-first century, clearly confirming that C. celata bioerosion can be expected to be enhanced with progressing ocean acidification (OA). Together with previously published experimental evidence, the present results suggest that OA accelerates sponge bioerosion (1) across latitudes and biogeographic areas, (2) independent of sponge growth form, and (3) for species with or without photosymbionts alike. A general increase in sponge bioerosion with advancing OA can be expected to have a significant impact on global carbonate (re)cycling and may result in widespread negative effects, e.g. on the stability of wild and farmed shellfish populations, as well as calcareous framework builders in tropical and cold-water coral reef ecosystems.", "title": "Sponge bioerosion accelerated by ocean acidification across species and latitudes?", "query": "Sponge bioerosion accelerated by ocean acidification across species and latitudes?"}

This system enables the evaluation of the six components of the Reynolds stress tensor throughout a large proportion of the water column. The present study provides mean vertical profiles of the velocity, the turbulence intensity and the integral lengthscale along the streamwise, spanwise and vertical direction of the tidal current. Based on our results and considering a tidal-stream energy convertor (TEC) aligned with the current main direction, the main elements of turbulence prone to affect the structure (material fatigue) and to alter power generation would likely be: (i) the streamwise turbulence intensity ( I  x  ), (ii) the shear stress,      v \u2032   w \u2032   \u00af    , (iii) the normal stress,     u  \u2032 2   \u00af    and (iv) the vertical integral lengthscale ( L  z  ). The streamwise turbulence intensity, ( I  x  ), was found to be higher than that estimated at other tidal energy sites across the world for similar height above bottom. Along the vertical direction, the length ( L  z  ) of the large-scale turbulence eddies was found to be equivalent to the rotor diameter of the TEC Sabella D10.

These local heterogeneities are often important or even fundamental to better understand general and large scale properties of the system, but they are either ignored or poorly parameterized in regional and global models. Because of their small scale, the underlying generating processes can be well explained and resolved only by local mechanistic models, which, on the other hand, fail to consider the regional or global influences of those features. A challenging problem is then how to deal with these interactions across different spatial scales, and how to improve our understanding of the role played by local soil heterogeneities in the climate system. This is of particular interest in the northern peatlands, because of the huge amount of carbon stored in these regions. Land-atmosphere greenhouse gas fluxes vary dramatically within these environments. Therefore, to correctly estimate the fluxes a description of the small scale soil variability is needed. Applications of statistical physics methods could be useful tools to upscale local features of the landscape, relating them to large-scale properties. To test this approach we considered a case study: the polygonal tundra. Cryogenic polygons, consisting mainly of elevated dry rims and wet low centers, pattern the terrain of many subartic regions and are generated by complex crack-and-growth processes. Methane, carbon dioxide and water vapor fluxes vary largely within the environment, as an effect of the small scale processes that characterize the landscape. It is then essential to consider the local heterogeneous behavior of the system components, such as the water table level inside the polygon wet centers, or the depth at which frozen soil thaws. We developed a stochastic model for this environment using Poisson-Voronoi diagrams, which is able to upscale statistical large scale properties of the system taking into account the main processes within the single polygons. We compare the results with available recent field studies and demonstrate that the model captures the main statistical characteristics of the landscape and describes its dynamical behavior under climatic forcings (e.g., precipitation and evapotranspiration). We analyze seasonal dynamics of water table variations and the landscape response under different scenarios of precipitation income. We upscale methane fluxes by using a simple idealized model for methane emission. We also investigate hydraulic interconnectivities and large-scale drainage through percolation properties and thresholds in the Voronoi-Deleaunay graph. The model captures the main statistical characteristics of the landscape topography, such as polygon area and surface properties as well as the water balance. This approach enables us to statistically relate large-scale properties of the system taking into account the main small-scale processes within the single polygons. Overall, the general agreement between field measurements and model results suggests that such statistical methods and simple parameterizations, if accurately tuned with field data, could be a powerful way to consider spatial scale interactions in such heterogenous and complex environments. http://www.earth-syst-dynam-discuss.net/3/453/2012/esdd-3-453-2012.html", "title": "A stochastic model for the polygonal tundra based on Poisson\u2013Voronoi diagrams", "query": "A stochastic model for the polygonal tundra based on Poisson\u2013Voronoi diagrams"}

Core MD03-2699 is the first high-resolution mid-Brunhes record from the North Atlantic\u2019s eastern boundary upwelling system covering the complete MIS 11c interval and MIS 13. The array of sites reflect western and eastern basin boundary current as well as north to south transect sampling of subpolar and transitional water masses and allow the reconstruction of transport pathways in the upper limb of the North Atlantic\u2019s circulation. Hydrographic conditions in the surface and deep ocean during peak interglacial MIS 9 and 11 were similar among all the sites with relative stable conditions and confirm prolonged warmth during MIS 11c also for the mid-latitudes. Sea surface temperature (SST) reconstructions further reveal that in the mid-latitude North Atlantic MIS 11c is associated with two plateaus, the younger one of which is slightly warmer. Enhanced subsurface northward heat transport in the eastern boundary current system, especially during early MIS 11c, is denoted by the presence of tropical planktic foraminifer species and raises the question how strongly it impacted the Portuguese upwelling system. Deep water ventilation at the onset of MIS 11c significantly preceded surface water ventilation. Although MIS 13 was generally colder and more variable than the younger interglacials the surface water circulation scheme was the same. The greatest differences between the sites existed during the glacial inceptions and glacials.

From this we extracted numbers of all 'known' sponges to date: the number of valid Recent sponges is established at 8,553, with the vast majority, 83%, belonging to the class Demospongiae. We also mapped for the first time the species richness of a comprehensive set of marine ecoregions of the world, data also extracted from the WPD. Perhaps not surprisingly, these distributions appear to show a strong bias towards collection and taxonomy efforts. Only when species richness is accumulated into large marine realms does a pattern emerge that is also recognized in many other marine animal groups: high numbers in tropical regions, lesser numbers in the colder parts of the world oceans. Preliminary similarity analysis of a matrix of species and marine ecoregions extracted from the WPD failed to yield a consistent hierarchical pattern of ecoregions into marine provinces. Global sponge diversity information is mostly generated in regional projects and resources: results obtained demonstrate that regional approaches to analytical biogeography are at present more likely to achieve insights into the biogeographic history of sponges than a global perspective, which appears currently too ambitious. We also review information on invasive sponges that might well have some influence on distribution patterns of the future.", "title": "Global Diversity of Sponges (Porifera)", "query": "Global Diversity of Sponges (Porifera)"}

These taxonomic problems are especially common in anurans, once they are very diverse, highly polymorphic, and present many cryptic species. The genus Thoropa Cope, 1865 is composed of six specialist species that reproduce in rocky outcrops and are distributed throughout the Atlantic Forest and Cerrado ecotones. Phylogenetic studies point to possible cryptic species within the T. miliaris group. To assist in the evolutionary and taxonomic understanding of this group, classical cytogenetic techniques were used to find possible molecular markers for the genus through rDNA5S, rDNA18S, and U2snDNA probes and analyze their chromosome distribution in the group of T. miliaris. Despite the well conserved karyotype under conventional staining and classical techniques, such as Ag-NOR, our C-banding results showed differences in the centromeric heterochromatin concentration between two populations of T. miliaris. Furthermore, some differences among the populations and species were found for rDNA5S and U2snDNA. This study contributes to a better understanding of the evolutionary relationships within the genus; however, the use of different probe sequences, such as satDNA, is essential for a more robust cytogenetic analysis.", "title": "Cytogenetic analysis of the genus Thoropa Cope, 1865 (Anura-Cycloramphidae) with evolutionary inferences based on repetitive sequences", "query": "Cytogenetic analysis of the genus Thoropa Cope, 1865 (Anura-Cycloramphidae) with evolutionary inferences based on repetitive sequences"}

This study aims to provide a holistic assessment of the biogeochemical recovery after a disturbance event by applying prognostic simulations based on an updated dia- genetic background model and validated against novel data on microbiological processes. It was found that the recov- ery strongly depends on the impact type; complete removal of the reactive surface sediment reduces benthic release of nutrients over centuries, while geochemical processes after resuspension and mixing of the surface sediment are near the pre-impact state 1 year after the disturbance. Furthermore, the geochemical impact in the DISturbance and reCOLo- nization (DISCOL) experiment area would be mitigated to some degree by a clay-bound Fe(II)-reaction layer, imped- ing the downward diffusion of oxygen, thus stabilizing the redox zonation of the sediment during transient post-impact recovery. The interdisciplinary (geochemical, numerical and biological) approach highlights the closely linked nature of benthic ecosystem functions, e.g. through bioturbation, mi- crobial biomass and nutrient \ufb02uxes, which is also of great importance for the system recovery. It is, however, important to note that the nodule ecosystem may never recover to the pre-impact state without the essential hard substrate and will instead be dominated by different faunal communities, func- tions and services.", "title": "Assessing the temporal scale of deep-sea mining impacts on sediment biogeochemistry", "query": "Assessing the temporal scale of deep-sea mining impacts on sediment biogeochemistry"}

Within some systematic groups a specific faunistic classification could clearly be defined, e.g. for asterozoans and holothurians. Whilst for fish, only a general zoogeographical pattern was discernible, there were some recognisable relationships to dtfferent microhabitats. The extreme differences in the distribution of sponges observed seems to reflect their lughly variable biological characteristics. Stu&es using underwater imaging methods for benthic research have provided strong evidence for the ecological signrficance of two factors. The first, iceberg scouring, leads to a variety of simultaneous stages of recolonization, which result in an increase in beta-diversity. As a consequence, it is unllkely that regionally a stage approaching atheoretical climax will ever be attained. Secondly, the structural diversity of living substrata provides the basis for an additional variety of epibiotic species. Only weak or non-detectable correlations have been found between benthic assemblages and physical parameters, such as water depth, sediment type, bathymetric features and the abundance of deposited phytodetritus. This indicates a benthic system which is relatively uncoupled from processes in the water column. The combination of stable environmental conditions and disturbances taking place over long periods of time, which are partly a special feature ofAntarctica's glacial history, shaped the diversity and faunal composition of the macrobenthos.

Indeed, current Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projections of an AMOC slowdown in the twenty-first century based on climate models are attributed to the inhibition of deep convection in the North Atlantic. However, observational evidence for this linkage has been elusive: there has been no clear demonstration of AMOC variability in response to changes in deep-water formation. The motivation for understanding this linkage is compelling, since the overturning circulation has been shown to sequester heat and anthropogenic carbon in the deep ocean. Furthermore, AMOC variability is expected to impact this sequestration as well as have consequences for regional and global climates through its effect on the poleward transport of warm water. Motivated by the need for a mechanistic understanding of the AMOC, an international community has assembled an observing system, Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program (OSNAP), to provide a continuous record of the transbasin fluxes of heat, mass, and freshwater, and to link that record to convective activity and water mass transformation at high latitudes. OSNAP, in conjunction with the Rapid Climate Change\u2013Meridional Overturning Circulation and Heatflux Array (RAPID\u2013MOCHA) at 26\u00b0N and other observational elements, will provide a comprehensive measure of the three-dimensional AMOC and an understanding of what drives its variability. The OSNAP observing system was fully deployed in the summer of 2014, and the first OSNAP data products are expected in the fall of 2017.", "title": "Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program: A New International Ocean Observing System", "query": "Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program: A New International Ocean Observing System"}

Yet, they are few and have low temporal resolution. At the time series station Point B in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea, seawater was sampled weekly from 2007 through 2015, at 1 and 50 m, and analyzed for total dissolved inorganic carbon (C T ) and total alkalinity (A T ). Parameters of the carbonate system such as pH (pH T , total hydrogen ion scale) were calculated and a deconvolution analysis was performed to identify drivers of change. The rate of surface ocean acidification was \u22120.0028 \u00b1 0.0003 units pH T yr \u22121 . This rate is larger than previously identified open-ocean trends due to rapid warming that occurred over the study period (0.072 \u00b1 0.022 \u2022 C yr \u22121 ). The total pH T change over the study period was of similar magnitude as the diel pH T variability at this site. The acidification trend can be attributed to atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) forcing (59 %, 2.08 \u00b1 0.01 ppm CO 2 yr \u22121 ) and warming (41 %). Similar trends were observed at 50 m but rates were generally slower. At 1 m depth, the increase in atmospheric CO 2 accounted for approximately 40 % of the observed increase in C T (2.97 \u00b1 0.20 \u00b5mol kg \u22121 yr \u22121 ). The remaining increase in C T may have been driven by the same unidentified process that caused an increase in A T (2.08 \u00b1 0.19 \u00b5mol kg \u22121 yr \u22121 ). Based on the analysis of monthly trends, synchronous increases in C T and A T were fastest in the spring-summer transition. The driving process of the interannual increase in A T has a seasonal and shallow component, which may indicate riverine or groundwater influence. This study exemplifies the importance of understanding changes in coastal carbonate chemistry through the lens of biogeochemical cycling at the land-sea interface. This is the first coastal acidification time series providing multiyear data at high temporal resolution. The data confirm rapid warming in the Mediterranean Sea and demonstrate coastal acidification with a synchronous increase in total alkalinity.", "title": "Coastal ocean acidification and increasing total alkalinity in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea", "query": "Coastal ocean acidification and increasing total alkalinity in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea"}

In total, 28 ascidians were identified at the species level and another 9 at the genus level based on morphology and genetic barcoding. Eight species were assigned to introduced forms, 15 were given native status and 5 were classified as cryptogenic. Aplidium accarense was reported for the first time in the Mediterranean Sea and was especially abundant in 23 of the harbors. Introduced and cryptogenic species were abundant in most of the surveyed harbors, while native forms were rare and restricted to a few harbors. Significant differences in the distribution of ascidians according to harbor type and latitudinal position were observed. These differences were due to the distribution of introduced species. We obtained a significant correlation between geographic distance and ascidian composition, indicating that closely located harbors shared more ascidian species among them. This study showed that harbors act as dispersal strongholds for introduced species, with native species only appearing sporadically, and that harbor type and geographic location should also be considered when developing management plans to constrain the spread of nonindigenous species in highly urbanized coastlines.", "title": "Harbor networks as introduction gateways: contrasting distribution patterns of native and introduced ascidians", "query": "Harbor networks as introduction gateways: contrasting distribution patterns of native and introduced ascidians"}

Here, we experimentally explore the impacts of inorganic nutrients and organic matter on a range of food web properties. We find that these two stressors combine additively to produce significant increases in connectance and mean food chain length. Such increases are typically associated with enhanced robustness to secondary extinctions and productivity, respectively. Despite these apparent beneficial effects, we find a simplification of web structure in terms of taxon richness and diversity, and altered proportions of basal and top species. These effects are driven by a reduction in community assembly and lower consistency in a range of system properties as a result of the multiple stressors.

The apparent lack of a locally self-maintaining krill population at South Georgia means that understanding the mechanism underlying these observed population characteristics is essential to successful ecosystem-based management of krill fishery in the region. Krill acoustic-density data from surveys conducted in the early, middle and late period of the summers of 2001 to 2005, together with krill population size structure over the same period from predator diet data, were used with a krill population dynamics model to evaluate potential mechanisms behind the observed changes in krill biomass. Krill abundance was highest during the middle of the summer in 3 years and in the late period in 2 years; in the latter there was evidence that krill recruitment was delayed by several months. A model scenario that included empirically derived estimates of both the magnitude and timing of recruitment in each year showed the greatest correlation with the acoustic series. The results are consistent with a krill population with allochthonous recruitment entering a retained adult population; i.e. oceanic transport of adult krill does not appear to be the major factor determining the dynamics of the adult population. The results highlight the importance of the timing of recruitment, especially where this could introduce a mismatch between the peak of krill abundance and the peak demand from predators, which may exacerbate the effects of changes in krill populations arising from commercial harvesting and/or climate change.", "title": "Krill population dynamics at South Georgia: implications for ecosystem-based fisheries management", "query": "Krill population dynamics at South Georgia: implications for ecosystem-based fisheries management"}

In this study, we examined whether communities would converge because similar taxa would be selected under the same environmental conditions, or would diverge because of initial community composition, after artificial dispersal. To this aim, a microcosm experiment was performed, in which the temporal changes in the composition and diversity of different prokaryoplankton assemblages from three distant geographic coastal areas (Banyuls-sur-Mer in northwest Mediterranean Sea, Pagasitikos Gulf in northeast Mediterranean and Woods Hole, MA, USA in the northwest Atlantic), were studied. Diversity was investigated using amplicon pyrosequencing of the V1-V3 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA. The three assemblages were grown separately in particle free and autoclaved Banyuls-sur-mer seawater at 18 \u2022 C in the dark. We found that the variability of prokaryoplankton community diversity (expressed as richness, evenness and dominance) as well as the composition were driven by patterns observed in Bacteria. Regarding community composition, similarities were found between treatments at family level. However, at the OTU level microbial communities from the three different original locations diverge rather than converge during incubation. It is suggested that slight differences in the composition of the initial prokaryoplankton communities, resulted in separate clusters the following days even when growth took place under identical abiotic conditions.", "title": "Changes in Microbial (Bacteria and Archaea) Plankton Community Structure after Artificial Dispersal in Grazer-Free Microcosms", "query": "Changes in Microbial (Bacteria and Archaea) Plankton Community Structure after Artificial Dispersal in Grazer-Free Microcosms"}

To understand adaptation and responses to change therefore requires knowledge of how variation is generated and distributed across traits. Variation occurs on different biological scales, from genetic through physiological to morphological, yet it is unclear which of these carries the most variability. For example, if individual variation is mainly generated by differences in gene expression, variability should decrease progressively from coding genes to morphological traits, whereas if post-translational and epigenetic effects increase variation, the opposite should occur. To test these predictions, we compared levels of variation among individuals in various measures of gene expression, physiology (including activity), and morphology in two abundant and geographically widespread Antarctic molluscs, the clam Laternula elliptica and the limpet Nacella concinna. Direct comparisons among traits as diverse as heat shock protein QPCR assays, whole transcription profiles, respiration rates, burying rate, shell length, and ash-free dry mass were made possible through the novel application of an established metric, the Wentworth Scale. In principle, this approach could be extended to analyses of populations, communities, or even entire ecosystems. We found consistently greater variation in gene expression than morphology, with physiological measures falling in between. This suggests that variability is generated at the gene expression level. These findings have important implications for refining current biological models and predictions of how biodiversity may respond to climate change.", "title": "Variability among individuals is generated at the gene expression level", "query": "Variability among individuals is generated at the gene expression level"}

For this purpose, a dinocyst reference dataset has been formed, based on 138 surface sediment samples from different circum-Antarctic environments. The dinocyst assemblages of these samples are composed of phototrophic (gonyaulacoid) and heterotrophic (protoperidinioid) species that provide a broad spectrum of palaeoenvironmental information. The relationship between the environmental parameters in the upper water column and the dinocyst distribution patterns of individual species has been established using the statistical method of Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). Among the variables tested, summer SST appeared to correspond to the maximum variance represented in the dataset.To establish quantitative summer SST reconstructions, a Modern Analogue Technique (MAT) has been performed on data from three Late Quaternary dinocyst records recovered from locations adjacent to prominent oceanic fronts in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. These dinocyst time series exhibit periodic changes in the dinocyst assemblage during the last two glacial/ interglacial-cycles. During glacial conditions the relative abundance of protoperidinioid cysts was highest, whereas interglacial conditions are characterised by generally lower cyst concentrations and increased relative abundance of gonyaulacoid cysts. The MAT palaeotemperature estimates show trends in summer SST changes following the global oxygen isotope signal and a strong correlation with past temperatures of the last 140 000 years based on other proxies. However, by comparing the dinocyst results to quantitative estimates of summer SSTs based on diatoms, radiolarians and foraminifer-derived stable isotope records it can be shown that in several core intervals the dinocyst-based summer SSTs appeared to be extremely high. In these intervals the dinocyst record seems to be highly influenced by selective degradation, leading to unusual temperature ranges and to unrealistic palaeotemperatures. We used the selective degradation index (kt-index) to determine those intervals that have been biased by selective degradation in order to correct the palaeotemperature estimates. We show that after correction the dinocyst based SSTs correspond reasonably well with other palaeotemperature estimates for this region, supporting the great potential of dinoflagellate cysts as a basis for quantitative palaeoenvironmental studies.", "title": "The potential of organic-walled dinoflagellate cysts for the reconstruction of past sea-surface conditions in the Southern Ocean", "query": "The potential of organic-walled dinoflagellate cysts for the reconstruction of past sea-surface conditions in the Southern Ocean"}

Addressing this question requires a system in which (i) local adaptation and the early stages of speciation can be clearly identified and distinguished, (ii) the amount of genetic divergence driven by the two processes is similar, and (iii) comparisons can be repeated both taxonomically (for local adaptation) and geographically (for speciation). Here, we report just such a situation in the hamlets (Hypoplectrus spp), brightly colored reef fishes from the wider Caribbean. Close to 100,000 SNPs genotyped in 126 individuals from three sympatric species sampled in three repeated populations provide genome-wide levels of divergence that are comparable among allopatric populations (F st estimate = 0.0042) and sympatric species (F st estimate = 0.0038). Population genetic, clustering, and phylogenetic analyses reveal very similar patterns for local adaptation and speciation, with a large fraction of the genome undifferentiated (F st estimate % 0), a very small proportion of F st outlier loci (0.05-0.07%), and remarkably few repeated outliers (1-3). Nevertheless, different loci appear to be involved in the two processes in Hypoplectrus, with only 7% of the most differentiated SNPs and outliers shared between populations and species comparisons. In particular, a tropomyosin (Tpm4) and a previously identified hox (HoxCa) locus emerge as candidate loci (repeated outliers) for local adaptation and speciation, respectively. We conclude that marine populations may be locally adapted notwithstanding shallow levels of genetic divergence, and that from a population genomic perspective, this process does not appear to differ fundamentally from the early stages of speciation.", "title": "Population genomics of local adaptation versus speciation in coral reef fishes ( Hypoplectrus spp, Serranidae)", "query": "Population genomics of local adaptation versus speciation in coral reef fishes ( Hypoplectrus spp, Serranidae)"}

A main donor region of non-indigenous species (NIS) for numerous European water bodies, as well as in the North American Great Lakes is the Ponto-Caspian region (i.e., Black, Azov and Caspian Seas), with some of those species having significant impact on local communities and ecosystem functioning. Location: Northern European, Ponto-Caspian and North American regions. Methods: To determine environmental tolerance of native species and related NIS under current and future global warming scenarios of the Baltic Sea, we conducted common garden experiments to test temperature tolerance of three euryhaline gammarid species: one Baltic (Gammarus oceanicus), one Ponto-Caspian (Pontogammarus maeoticus) and one North American species (Gammarus tigrinus) in two different salinities.Results: Our results determined that mortality of P. maeoticus in all temperature treatments (i.e., increased, control, and decreased) at the end of both experiments (i.e., conducted in salinities of 10 and 16 g/kg) was lower when compared to mortality of G. oceanicus and (c) G. tigrinus. The highest mortality was observed for G. oceanicus, reaching 100% in both experiments in the increased temperature treatment.Main conclusions:Due to the high environmental tolerance of the Ponto-Caspian species tested in this study, as well as the fact that Ponto-Caspian species evolved in environmentally variable habitats and currently inhabit warmer waters than species from North America and Northern Europe, we suggest that species from the Ponto-Caspian region may benefit from global warming when invading new areas.

A number of characteristics, including greater-than-expected deep-sea carbonate dissolution, a lack of globally coherent negative \u03b4 13 C excursion in marine carbonates, a duration longer than the characteristic timescale of carbon cycle recovery, and the absence of a clear trigger mechanism, challenge our current understanding of the Earth system and its regulatory feedbacks. This makes the MECO one of the most enigmatic events in the Cenozoic, dubbed a middle Eocene \\carbon cycle conundrum.\\ Here we use boron isotopes in planktic foraminifera to better constrain pCO 2 changes over the event. Over the MECO itself, we find that pCO 2 rose by only 0.55-0.75 doublings, thus requiring a much more modest carbon injection than previously indicated by the alkenone \u03b4 13 C-pCO 2 proxy. In addition, this rise in pCO 2 was focused around the peak of the 400 kyr warming trend. Before this, considerable global carbonate \u03b4 18 O change was asynchronous with any coherent ocean pH (and hence pCO 2 ) excursion. This finding suggests that middle Eocene climate (and perhaps a nascent cryosphere) was highly sensitive to small changes in radiative forcing.Plain Language Summary Geoscientists often look to periods of global warming in the geological past to understand how the Earth responds to input of atmospheric CO 2 . However, during the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum (or MECO) 40 million years ago, the Earth did not respond in the way one would expect, given what we know from these earlier warming events. The MECO poses a number of puzzles for geoscientists relating to what caused it and why the Earth system responded in the way it did. Before we can hope to answer these questions, however, we need to know what atmospheric CO 2 levels were in the middle Eocene and how much they changed over the MECO event. Here we use boron isotope ratios in fossil plankton shells to tell us how ocean pH (which predominantly reflects CO 2 levels) changed over the MECO. We show that relatively little change in CO 2 at this time were associated with large-scale changes in climate. This suggests that during the Eocene, when CO 2 levels were similar to those likely to be reached by the end of this century, the Earth's climate (and possibly ice sheets) was very sensitive to minor disturbances.", "title": "Revisiting the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum \u201cCarbon Cycle Conundrum\u201d With New Estimates of Atmospheric pCO 2 From Boron Isotopes", "query": "Revisiting the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum \u201cCarbon Cycle Conundrum\u201d With New Estimates of Atmospheric pCO 2 From Boron Isotopes"}

Glacial-interglacial amplitudes of the planktonic \u03b418O records are 1.1\u20131.3\u2030, less than half the amplitude observed at core sites at similar latitudes in the North Atlantic; these data imply that a strong, negative \u03b4w anomaly existed in the glacial Subarctic mixed layer during the summer, which points to a much stronger low-salinity anomaly than exists today. If true, the upper water column in the North Pacific would have been statically more stable than today, thus suppressing convection even more efficiently. This scenario is further supported by vertical (i.e., planktic versus benthic) \u03b418O and \u03b413C gradients of >1\u2030, which suggest that a thermohaline link between Pacific deep waters and the Subarctic Pacific mixed layer did not exist during the late glacial. Epibenthic \u03b413C in the Subarctic Pacific is more negative than at tropical-subtropical Pacific sites but similar to that recorded at Southern Ocean sites, suggesting ventilation of the deep central Pacific from mid-latitude sources, e.g., from the Sea of Japan and Sea of Okhotsk. Still, convection to intermediate depths could have occurred in the Subarctic during the winter months when heat loss to the atmosphere, sea ice formation, and wind-driven upwelling of saline deep waters would have been most intense.

We focussed on two dominant ecosystem engineers at the Mingulay Reef Complex, the coral Lophelia pertusa (rubble, live and dead framework) and the sponge Spongosorites coralliophaga. Firstly, from combining biological (high-definition video, collected specimens), environmental (extracted from multibeam bathymetry) and ecosystem function (oxygen consumption rate values) data, we calculated biomass, C stock and turnover which can feed into assessments of C budgets. Secondly, using those values, we employed random forest modelling to predictively map whole-reef live coral and sponge biomass. The whole-reef mean biomass of S. coralliophaga was estimated to be 304 T (range 168\u2013440 T biomass), containing 10 T C (range 5\u201318 T C) stock. The mean skeletal mass of the coral colonies (live and dead framework) was estimated to be 3874 T (range 507\u20139352 T skeletal mass), containing a mean of 209 T of biomass (range 26\u2013515 T biomass) and a mean of 465 T C (range 60\u20131122 T C) stock. These estimates were used to calculate the C turnover rates, using respiration data available in the literature. These calculations revealed that the epi- and microbial fauna associated with coral rubble were the largest contributor towards C turnover in the area with a mean of 163 T C year\u22121 (range 149\u2013176 T C year\u22121). The live and dead framework of L. pertusa were estimated to overturn a mean of 32 T C year\u22121 (range 4\u201393 T C year\u22121) and 44 T C year\u22121 (range 6\u2013139 T C year\u22121), respectively. Our calculations showed that the Mingulay Reef overturned three to seven (with a mean of four) times more C than a soft-sediment area at a similar depth. As proof of concept, the supply of C needed from surface water primary productivity to the reef was inferred. Since 65\u2013124 T C year\u22121 is supplied by natural deposition and our study suggested that a mean of 241 T C year\u22121 (range 160\u2013400 T C year\u22121), was turned over by the reef, a mean of 117\u2013176 T C year\u22121 (range 36\u2013335 T C year\u22121) of the reef would therefore be supplied by tidal downwelling and/or deep-water advection. Our results indicate that monitoring and/or managing surface primary productivity would be a key consideration for any efforts towards the conservation of cold-water coral reef ecosystems.", "title": "Mapping cold-water coral biomass: an approach to derive ecosystem functions", "query": "Mapping cold-water coral biomass: an approach to derive ecosystem functions"}

The Gollum Channels and Whittard Canyon harboured high meiofauna abundances (1054-1426 ind. 10 cm 22 ) and high nematode diversity (total of 181 genera). Next to enhanced meiofauna abundance and nematode biomass, there were signs of high levels of organic matter deposition leading to reduced sedimentary conditions, which in turn structured the nematode community. Striking in this respect was the presence of large numbers of 'chemosynthetic' Astomonema nematodes (Astomonema southwardorum, Order Monhysterida, Family Siphonolaimidae). This genus lacks a mouth, buccal cavity and pharynx and possesses a rudimentary gut containing internal, symbiotic prokaryotes which have been recognised as sulphur-oxidising bacteria. Dominance of Astomonema may indicate the presence of reduced environments in the study areas, which is partially confirmed by the local biogeochemical environment. The nematode communities were mostly affected by sediment layer differences and concomitant trophic conditions rather than other spatial gradients related to study area, water depth or station differences, pointing to small-scale heterogeneity as the main source of variation in nematode structure and function. Furthermore, the positive relation between nematode standing stocks, and quantity and quality of the organic matter was stronger when hydrodynamic disturbance was greater. Analogically, this study also suggests that structural diversity can be positively correlated with trophic conditions and that this relation is tighter when hydrodynamic disturbance is greater.", "title": "Meiofauna in the Gollum Channels and the Whittard Canyon, Celtic Margin\u2014How Local Environmental Conditions Shape Nematode Structure and Function", "query": "Meiofauna in the Gollum Channels and the Whittard Canyon, Celtic Margin\u2014How Local Environmental Conditions Shape Nematode Structure and Function"}

Here, we present pollen, sediment, and ground-ice stable water isotope data obtained from coastal exposures on Bol'shoy Lyakhovsky Island (New Siberian Archipelago, Arctic Ocean) that mirror the coldest conditions during the Sartan period between about 26 and 22 ka BP, using pollen and sediment data for summer conditions and stable water isotope data for winter conditions. The pollen record revealed a cold tundra-steppe vegetation with characteristic predominance of grass pollen over sedge pollen while the stable isotope ice-wedges data indicate extremely cold winter temperatures with mean values of d 18 O of about \u00c037&, dD of about \u00c0290&. Combined with available regional LGM permafrost records that extend from the Taymyr Peninsula in the west to the Yana River lowland in the east, the new data set from Bol'shoy Lyakhovsky Island indicate that the regional appearance of LGM conditions depended on atmospheric circulation patterns that were influenced by the extent of the Northern Hemisphere glaciation.", "title": "Last Glacial Maximum records in permafrost of the East Siberian Arctic", "query": "Last Glacial Maximum records in permafrost of the East Siberian Arctic"}

This has led to the emergence of modelling methods to predict the occurrence of suitable habitat for conservation planning in data-sparse areas. Recent global analyses for cold-water corals predict a high probability of occurrence along the slopes of continental margins, offshore banks and seamounts in the north-eastern Atlantic, but tend to overestimate the extent of the habitat and do not provide the detail needed for finer-scale assessments and protected area planning. Using Lophelia pertusa reefs as an example, this study integrates multibeam bathymetry with a wide range of environmental data to produce a regional high-resolution habitat suitability map relevant for marine spatial planning.Location Irish continental margin (extended continental shelf claim).Methods Maximum entropy modelling was used to predict L. pertusa reef distribution at a spatial resolution of 0.002\u00b0. Coral occurrences were assembled from public databases, publications and video footage, and filtered for quality. Environmental predictor variables were produced by re-sampling of global oceanographic data sets and a regional ocean circulation model. Multi-scale terrain parameters were computed from multibeam bathymetry.Results Suitable habitat was predicted on mound features and in canyon areas along a narrow band following the slopes of the Irish continental margin, the Rockall Bank and the Porcupine Bank. Standard deviation of the seabed slope (54%), temperature (28%) and bottom shear stress (9%) were the most important variables to predict coral distribution.Main conclusions This is the first regional coral habitat suitability modelling study to incorporate full coverage multibeam bathymetry in the deep sea. The use of high-resolution environmental data and quality-controlled distribution data significantly reduces habitat overestimation demonstrated by global-scale analyses and produces detailed maps to support marine protected area network design. The strong response of the corals to local-scale terrain variability highlights the need to protect the seabed from anthropogenic impacts that may reduce its complexity, such as bottom trawling.", "title": "High-resolution habitat suitability modelling can improve conservation of vulnerable marine ecosystems in the deep sea", "query": "High-resolution habitat suitability modelling can improve conservation of vulnerable marine ecosystems in the deep sea"}

Thus, identifying the relative and synergistic roles of these forces and how they differ across habitats, ecosystems, or primary-producer types is increasingly important for understanding how communities are structured. We used factorial meta-analysis of 54 field experiments that orthogonally manipulated herbivore pressure and nutrient loading to quantify consumer and nutrient effects on primary producers in benthic marine habitats. Across all experiments and producer types, herbivory and nutrient enrichment both significantly affected primaryproducer abundance. They also interacted to create greater nutrient enrichment effects in the absence of herbivores, suggesting that loss of herbivores produces more dramatic effects of nutrient loading. Herbivores consistently had stronger effects than did nutrient enrichment for both tropical macroalgae and seagrasses. The strong effects of herbivory but limited effects of nutrient enrichment on tropical macroalgae suggest that suppression of herbivore populations has played a larger role than eutrophication in driving the phase shift from coral-to macroalgal-dominated reefs in many areas, especially the Caribbean. For temperate macroalgae and benthic microalgae, the effects of top-down and bottom-up forces varied as a function of the inherent productivity of the ecosystem. For these algal groups, nutrient enrichment appeared to have stronger effects in high-vs. low-productivity systems, while herbivores exerted a stronger top-down effect in low-productivity systems. Effects of herbivores vs. nutrients also varied among algal functional groups (crustose algae, upright macroalgae, and filamentous algae), within a functional group between temperate and tropical systems, and according to the metric used to measure producer abundance. These analyses suggest that human alteration of food webs and nutrient availability have significant effects on primary producers but that the effects vary among latitudes and primary producers, and with the inherent productivity of ecosystems.", "title": "HERBIVORE VS.

In this study, we investigated how the combination of citizen science, to detect objects, and machine learning, to classify megafauna, could be used to automate annotation of underwater images. For this purpose, multiple large data sets of citizen science annotations with different degrees of common errors and inaccuracies observed in citizen science data were simulated by modifying \\gold standard\\ annotations done by an experienced marine biologist. The parameters of the simulation were determined on the basis of two citizen science experiments.

This information is complementary to a review on shallow-water work along the Scotia Arc (Barnes, 2005) and recent work done in the deep sea (Brandt and Hilbig, 2004). While principally referring to shipboard work in deeper water, above all during the recent international EASIZ and LAMPOS campaigns, relevant work from shore stations is also included. Six years after the first IBMANT symposium, significant progress has been made along the latitudinal gradient from the Magellan region to the high Antarctic in the fields of biodiversity, biogeography and community structure, life strategies and adaptations, the role of disturbance and its significance for biodiversity, and trophic coupling of the benthic realm with the water column and sea ice. A better understanding has developed of the role of evolutionary and ecological factors in shaping past and present-day environmental conditions, species composition and distribution, and ecosystem functioning. Furthermore, the science community engaged in unravelling Antarctic-Magellan interactions has advanced in methodological aspects such as new analytical approaches for comparing biodiversity derived from visual methods, growth and age determination, trophic modelling using stable isotope ratios, and molecular approaches for taxonomic and phylogenetic purposes. At the same time, much effort has been invested to complement the species inventory of the two adjacent regions. However, much work remains to be done to fill the numerous gaps.

Correlation of series in the vertical and among sections, autocorrelation and estimates of the effect of the noise induced by the mesoscale field, all indicate that observed signatures are robust changes of water masses at the regional scale. The hydrographic time series are not characterized by smooth trends but instead by shifts that persist through consecutive cruises. The most notable features include a shift to more saline central waters around 2005 after which they remained stable, and a decrease in thermohaline properties of the Labrador Sea Water from autumn 2008 to 2010. Years with a strong winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index are characterized by shifts in thermohaline properties across most of the intermediate levels, with the most notable event being the warming and increasing salinity that followed the large NAO index drop of 2010. The observations are consistent with current understanding of the large-scale functioning of the North Atlantic, which predicts a northeastward expansion of subtropical temperate waters in the eastern boundary as a response to NAO forcing.

Fish show a capacity for compensatory growth after alleviation of dietary restriction, but the underlying cellular mechanisms are unknown. To learn more about the contribution of genes regulating hypertrophy (an increase in muscle fibre size) and hyperplasia (the generation of new muscle fibres) in the compensatory muscle growth response in fish, we used high-density microarray analysis to investigate the global gene expression in muscle of trout during a fasting-refeeding schedule and in muscle of control-fed trout displaying normal growth. Results: The compensatory muscle growth signature, as defined by genes up-regulated in muscles of refed trout compared with control-fed trout, showed enrichment in functional categories related to protein biosynthesis and maturation, such as RNA processing, ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis, ribosome biogenesis, translation and protein folding. This signature was also enriched in chromatin-remodelling factors of the protein arginine N-methyl transferase family. Unexpectedly, functional categories related to cell division and DNA replication were not inferred from the molecular signature of compensatory muscle growth, and this signature contained virtually none of the genes previously reported to be up-regulated in hyperplastic growth zones of the late trout embryo myotome and to potentially be involved in production of new myofibres, notably genes encoding myogenic regulatory factors, transmembrane receptors essential for myoblast fusion or myofibrillar proteins predominant in nascent myofibres. Conclusion: Genes promoting myofibre growth, but not myofibre formation, were up-regulated in muscles of refed trout compared with continually fed trout. This suggests that a compensatory muscle growth response, resulting from the stimulation of hypertrophy but not the stimulation of hyperplasia, occurs in trout after refeeding. The generation of a large set of genes up-regulated in muscle of refed trout may yield insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms controlling skeletal muscle mass in teleost and serve as a useful list of potential molecular markers of muscle growth in fish.", "title": "Global gene expression in muscle from fasted/refed trout reveals up-regulation of genes promoting myofibre hypertrophy but not myofibre production", "query": "Global gene expression in muscle from fasted/refed trout reveals up-regulation of genes promoting myofibre hypertrophy but not myofibre production"}

Warming and acidification induced a shift in the clam's feeding mode from predominantly suspension feeding under ambient conditions to deposit feeding with cascading effects on nutrient supply to primary producers. Surface-dwelling invertebrates were more tolerant to warming and acidification in the presence of S. plana, most likely due to the stimulatory effect of the clam on their microalgal food resources.

Although recovery from scouring has been quantified in time, the frequency of scouring in the Antarctic has not. We placed grids of markers at 9-17 m depth at two sites, to study icescouring over 2 years at Adelaide island (Antarctic Peninsula). We quantified the time scale of scour frequencies, and linked this to community mortality, age and diversity. Markers were hit from zero to at least three times in 2 years. At the least disturbed site (South Cove) 24% of markers were destroyed per year, whereas in North Cove 60% of markers were destroyed. There were significant differences in scouring frequency between our two sites: a given area in North Cove was on average hit twice as often as one in South Cove. Compared with near shore environments elsewhere, faunas of both sites were characteristic of high disturbance regimes, exhibiting low percent cover, diversity, ages and a high proportion of pioneers. Aspects of the encrusting communities studied reflected the differences between site disturbance regimes. North Cove was scoured twice as often, and bryozoan communities there had half the number of species, twothirds the space occupation and twice the mortality level of those in South Cove. Maximum age in North Cove bryozoans was also half that in South Cove. Although there are natural disturbance events that rival ice-scouring in either frequency or catastrophic power at lower latitudes, none do both nor across such a wide depth range. We suggest that ice scour effects on polar benthos are even more significant than the same magnitude of disturbance at lower latitudes as recovery rates of high latitude communities are very slow.

Xanthophyll pigments provide one of the most important photoprotective mechanisms to dissipate the excess light energy and prevent photoinhibition. In this study, we coupled a mechanistic model for phytoplankton photoinhibition with the global biogeochemical model Regulated Ecosystem Model version 2.The assumption that photoinhibition is small in phytoplankton communities acclimated to ambient light allowed us to predict the photoprotective needs of phytoplankton. When comparing the predicted photoprotective needs to observations of pigment content determined by high-performance liquid chromatography, our results showed that photoprotective response seems to be mediated in most parts of the ocean by a variable ratio of xanthophyll pigments to chlorophyll. The variability in the ratio appeared to be mainly driven by changes in phytoplankton community composition. Exceptions appeared at high latitudes where other energy dissipating mechanisms seem to play a role in photoprotection and both taxonomic changes and physiological acclimation determine community pigment signature.

The purpose of GTN-P is to establish an early warning system for the consequences of climate change in permafrost regions and to provide standardized thermal permafrost data to global models. In this paper we introduce the GTN-P database and perform statistical analysis of the GTN-P metadata to identify and quantify the spatial gaps in the site distribution in relation to climate-effective environmental parameters. We describe the concept and structure of the data management system in regard to user operability, data transfer and data policy. We outline data sources and data processing including quality control strategies based on national correspondents. Assessment of the metadata and data quality reveals 63 % metadata completeness at active layer sites and 50 % metadata completeness for boreholes.Voronoi tessellation analysis on the spatial sample distribution of boreholes and active layer measurement sites quantifies the distribution inhomogeneity and provides a potential method to locate additional permafrost research sites by improving the representativeness of thermal monitoring across areas underlain by permafrost. The depth distribution of the boreholes reveals that 73 % are shallower than 25 m and 27 % are deeper, reaching a maximum of 1 km depth. Comparison of the GTN-P site distribution with permafrost zones, soil organic carbon contents and vegetation types exhibits different local to regional monitoring situations, which are illustrated with maps. Preferential slope orientation at the sites most likely causes a bias in the temperature monitoring and should be taken into account when using the data for global models.

EU [218812]; CNES [82394/00] This work was carried out within the scope of the MyOcean project (Development and pre-operational validation of GMES Marine Core Services; 2009-2012) and was funded within the call for proposal EU FP7-SPACE-2007-1 (Grant Agreement nr. 218812) and with support from CNES under contract 82394/00. 3 COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH GOTTINGEN OCEAN SCI This paper describes an observation-based approach that efficiently combines the main components of the global ocean observing system using statistical methods. Accurate but sparse in situ temperature and salinity profiles (mainly from Argo for the last 10 yr) are merged with the lower accuracy but high-resolution synthetic data derived from satellite altimeter and sea surface temperature observations to provide global 3-D temperature and salinity fields at high temporal and spatial resolution. The first step of the method consists in deriving synthetic temperature fields from altimeter and sea surface temperature observations, and salinity fields from altimeter observations, through multiple/simple linear regression methods. The second step of the method consists in combining the synthetic fields with in situ temperature and salinity profiles using an optimal interpolation method. Results show the revolutionary nature of the Argo observing system. Argo observations now allow a global description of the statistical relationships that exist between surface and subsurface fields needed for step 1 of the method, and can constrain the large-scale temperature and mainly salinity fields during step 2 of the method. Compared to the use of climatological estimates, results indicate that up to 50% of the variance of the temperature fields can be reconstructed from altimeter and sea surface temperature observations and a statistical method. For salinity, only about 20 to 30% of the signal can be reconstructed from altimeter observations, making the in situ observing system essential for salinity estimates. The in situ observations (step 2 of the method) further reduce the differences between the gridded products and the observations by up to 20% for the temperature field in the mixed layer, and the main contribution is for salinity and the near surface layer with an improvement up to 30%. Compared to estimates derived using in situ observations only, the merged fields provide a better reconstruction of the high resolution temperature and salinity fields. This also holds for the large-scale and low-frequency fields thanks to a better reduction of the aliasing due to the mesoscale variability. Contribution of the merged fields is then illustrated to describe qualitatively the temperature variability patterns for the period from 1993 to 2009.", "title": "High resolution 3-D temperature and salinity fields derived from in situ and satellite observations", "query": "High resolution 3-D temperature and salinity fields derived from in situ and satellite observations"}

Continuous measurements of horizontal velocity and temperature for more than 2 years allow us to estimate the kinetic energy density and the energy fluxes of the waves. We found that there is a remarkable phase locking and linear relationship between the semidiurnal energy density and the tidal energy conversion at the spring-neap cycle. The energy-to-conversion ratio gives replenishment time scales of 4-5 days on the ridge top versus 7-9 days on the flanks. Altogether, these results demonstrate that the bulk of the tidal energy on the ridge comes from near-local sources, with a redistribution of energy from the top to the flanks, which is endorsed by the energy fluxes oriented in the cross-ridge direction. Implications for tidally driven energy dissipation are discussed. The time-averaged near-inertial kinetic energy is smaller than the semidiurnal kinetic energy by a factor of 2-3 but is much more variable in time. It features a strong seasonal cycle with a winter intensification and subseasonal peaks associated with local wind bursts. The ratio of energy to wind work gives replenishment time scales of 13-15 days, which is consistent with the short time scales of observed variability of near-inertial energy. In the upper ocean (1 km), the highest levels of near-inertial energy are preferentially found in anticyclonic structures, with a twofold increase relative to cyclonic structures, illustrating the funneling effect of anticyclones.", "title": "Tidal and Near-Inertial Internal Waves over the Reykjanes Ridge", "query": "Tidal and Near-Inertial Internal Waves over the Reykjanes Ridge"}

Here, we present a 25-year data record of cloud base height measured by ceilometer at the Ny-\u00c5lesund, Svalbard, Arctic site. We explain the composition of the three sub-periods with different instrumentation contributing to the data set, and show examples of potential application areas.

Furthermore, it is a useful auxiliary component for the analysis of advanced technologies that provide insight into cloud microphysical properties, like the cloud radar. The long-term time series also allows derivation of an annual cycle of the cloud occurrence frequency, revealing the more frequent cloud cover in summer and the lowest cloud cover amount in April.

Controlled by climate cell boundary displacement, NPSH midwinter location was the primary influence on timing and intensity of upwelling seasons in Guaymas Basin. Analysis of high-resolution X-ray fluoresence data and sediment fabric log from 75% laminated Core MD02-2517/2515, western Guaymas Basin, reveals systematic changes in NPSH behavior over the last ~55 kyr BP. Southward displacement of the wet/dry subtropical divide controlled upwelling-related diatom productivity, while sea level and regional rainfall controlled terrigenous supply. The basin was oxic during the glacial, and preservation was ensured by high burial rate due to the increased deposition of terrigenous sediment. Sediment fabric style (number and/or thickness of laminae, plus color banding and homogeneous intervals) changes systematically through the core and gives insights into the number of seasons occurring in Guaymas Basin, and the occurrence and intensity of the upwelling season.

The data reveal considerable temporal changes in the type of thermohaline circulation. Open-water convection prevailed in the early record, providing moisture for the Fennoscandian-Barents ice sheets to grow until they reached the shelf break at &26 cal. kyr and started to deliver high amounts of ice-rafted debris (IRD) into the ocean via melting icebergs. Low epibenthic O values and small-sized subpolar foraminifera observed after 26 cal. kyr may implicate that advection of Atlantic water into the Nordic seas occurred at the subsurface until 15 cal. kyr. Although modern-like surface and deep-water conditions \\rst developed at &13.5 cal. kyr, thermohaline circulation remained unstable, switching between a subsurface and surface advection of Atlantic water until 10 cal. kyr when IRD deposition and major input of meltwater ceased. During this time, two depletions in epibenthic C are recognized just before and after the Younger Dryas indicating a notable reduction in convectional processes. Despite an intermittent cooling at &8 cal. kyr, warmest surface conditions existed in the central Nordic seas between 10 and 6 cal. kyr. However, already after 7 cal. kyr the present day situation gradually evolved, veri\\ed by a strong water mass exchange with the Arctic Ocean and an intensifying deep convection as well as surface temperature decrease in the central Nordic seas. This process led to the development of the modern distribution of water masses and associated oceanographic fronts after 5 cal. kyr and, eventually, to today's steep east}west surface temperature gradient. The time discrepancy between intensive vertical convection after 5 cal. kyr but warmest surface temperatures already between 10 and 6 cal. kyr strongly implicates that widespread postglacial surface warming in the Nordic seas was not directly linked to the rates in deep-water formation.", "title": "A multiproxy reconstruction of the evolution of deep and surface waters in the subarctic Nordic seas over the last 30,000 yr", "query": "A multiproxy reconstruction of the evolution of deep and surface waters in the subarctic Nordic seas over the last 30,000 yr"}

In this study, we conducted fertilization experiments to assess the effects of selected pH scenarios on fertilization success of Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis, from Spitsbergen, Arctic. Acidification was achieved by aerating seawater with different CO 2 partial pressures to represent preindustrial and present conditions (measured *180-425 latm) and future acidification scenarios (*550-800, *1,300, *2,000 latm). Fertilization success was defined as the proportion of successful/unsuccessful fertilizations per treatment; eggs were classified according to features of their fertilization envelope (FE), hyaline layer (HL) and achievement of cellular division. The diagnostic findings of specific pathological aberrations were described in detail. We additionally measured intracellular pH changes in unfertilized eggs exposed for 1 h to selected acidification treatments using BCECF/AM. We conclude that (a) acidified conditions increase the proportion of eggs that failed fertilization, (b) acidification may increase the risk of polyspermy due to failures in the FE formation supported by the occasional observation of multiple sperms in the perivitelline space and (c) irregular formation of the embryo may arise due to impaired formation of the HL. The decrease in fertilization success could be also related to the observed changes in intracellular pH at pCO 2 * 1,000 latm or higher.", "title": "CO2-induced fertilization impairment in Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis collected in the Arctic", "query": "CO2-induced fertilization impairment in Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis collected in the Arctic"}

We distinguish two main contrasted situations: (1) concomitant changes in Chla and b bp that correspond to actual variations in phytoplankton biomass, e.g., in subpolar regimes; (2) a decoupling between the two variables attributed to photoacclimation or changes in the relative abundance of nonalgal particles, e.g., in subtropical regimes. The variability in the b bp :Chla ratio in the surface layer appears to be essentially influenced by the type of particles and by photoacclimation processes.

We use transient simulations from a coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model, as well as an ensemble of time slice simulations from the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project. The general pattern of sea surface temperature (SST) in the models shows a high-latitude cooling and a low-latitude warming. The proxy dataset comprises a global compilation of marine alkenone-and Mg/Ca-derived SST estimates. Independently of the choice of the climate model, we observe significant mismatches between modelled and estimated SST amplitudes in the trends for the last 6000 yr. Alkenone-based SST records show a similar pattern as the simulated annual mean SSTs, but the simulated SST trends underestimate the alkenone-based SST trends by a factor of two to five. For Mg/Ca, no significant relationship between model simulations and proxy reconstructions can be detected. We test if such discrepancies can be caused by too simplistic interpretations of the proxy data. We explore whether consideration of different growing seasons and depth habitats of the planktonic organisms used for temperature reconstruction could lead to a better agreement of model results with proxy data on a regional scale. The extent to which temporal shifts in growing season or vertical shifts in depth habitat can reduce model-data misfits is determined. We find that invoking shifts in the living season and habitat depth can remove some of the model-data discrepancies in SST trends. Regardless whether such adjustments in the environmental parameters during the Holocene are realistic, they indicate that when modelled temperature trends are set up to allow drastic shifts in the ecological behaviour of planktonic organisms, they do not capture the full range of reconstructed SST trends.

Brooding and encapsulation strategies are typically assumed to confer greater safety and protection to embryos, although little is known about the physico-chemical conditions within egg capsules. In the context of ocean acidification, the protective role of encapsulation remains to be investigated. To address this issue, we conducted experiments on the gastropod Crepidula fornicata. This species broods its embryos within capsules located under the female and veliger larvae are released directly into the water column. C. fornicata adults were reared at the current level of CO 2 partial pressure (pCO 2 ) (390 matm) and at elevated levels (750 and 1400 matm) before and after fertilization and until larval release, such that larval development occurred entirely at a given pCO 2 . The pCO 2 effects on shell morphology, the frequency of abnormalities and mineralization level were investigated on released larvae. Shell length decreased by 6% and shell surface area by 11% at elevated pCO 2 (1400 matm). The percentage of abnormalities was 1.5-to 4-fold higher at 750 matm and 1400 matm pCO 2 , respectively, than at 390 matm. The intensity of birefringence, used as a proxy for the mineralization level of the larval shell, also decreased with increasing pCO 2 . These negative results are likely explained by increased intracapsular acidosis due to elevated pCO 2 in extracapsular seawater. The encapsulation of C. fornicata embryos did not protect them against the deleterious effects of a predicted pCO 2 increase. Nevertheless, C. fornicata larvae seemed less affected than other mollusk species.

However, genome-wide verification of the steps in this process has seldom been applied. We used ddRADseq to generate SNP markers in a meiotic gynogenetic family of European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax): (i) to verify the lack of paternal contribution in a meiotic gynogenetic family; (ii) to generate a gene-centromere map from this family; (iii) to identify telomeric markers that could distinguish mitotic gynogenetics from meiotic gynogenetics, which sometimes arise spontaneously in mitotic gynogenetic families. Results: From a single meiotic gynogenetic family consisting of 79 progeny, 42 million sequencing reads (Illumina, trimmed to 148 bases) resolved 6866 unique RAD-tags. The 340 male-informative SNP markers that were identified confirmed the lack of paternal contribution. A gene-centromere map was constructed based on 804 female-informative SNPs in 24 linkage groups (2n = 48) with a total length of 1251.02 cM (initial LG assignment was based on the seabass genome assembly, dicLab v1). Chromosome arm structure could be clearly discerned from the pattern of heterozygosity in each linkage group in 18 out of 24 LGs: the other six showed anomalies that appeared to be related to issues in the genome assembly. Conclusion: Genome-wide screening enabled substantive verification of the production of the gynogenetic family used in this study. The large number of telomeric and subtelomeric markers with high heterozygosity values in the meiotic gynogenetic family indicate that such markers could be used to clearly distinguish between meiotic and mitotic gynogenetics.", "title": "Gene-centromere mapping in meiotic gynogenetic European seabass", "query": "Gene-centromere mapping in meiotic gynogenetic European seabass"}

The supply of bioavailable Fe is, therefore, not significantly related to the canyon transport of deep water.

Freshly erupted muds hosted deep-subsurface communities that were dominated by Bathyarchaeota, Atribacteria and Chloroflexi. Methanotrophy was initially limited to a thin surface layer of Methylococcales populations consuming methane aerobically. With increasing distance to the eruptive center, anaerobic methanotrophic archaea, sulfatereducing Desulfobacterales and thiotrophic Beggiatoaceae developed, and their respective metabolic capabilities dominated the biogeochemical functions of the community. Microbial richness, evenness, and cell numbers of the entire microbial community increased up to tenfold within a few years downstream of the mud flow from the eruptive center. The increasing diversity was accompanied by an up to fourfold increase in sequence abundance of relevant metabolic genes of the anaerobic methanotrophic and thiotrophic guilds. The communities fundamentally changed in their structure and functions as reflected in the metagenome turnover with distance from the eruptive center, and this was reflected in the biogeochemical zonation across the mud volcano caldera.

Phases of weaker (stronger) interior transport are associated with phases of higher (lower) equatorial SST. At these time scales, STC transport variability is forced by off\u2010equatorial wind stress changes, especially by those in the southern hemisphere. At shorter time scales, equatorial SST anomalies are, instead, mainly forced by local changes of zonal wind stress.", "title": "Observed Transport Variability of the Atlantic Subtropical Cells and Their Connection to Tropical Sea Surface Temperature Variability", "query": "Observed Transport Variability of the Atlantic Subtropical Cells and Their Connection to Tropical Sea Surface Temperature Variability"}

This paper inte- grated the findings of reviews of major world regions by the Census and provides a global perspective on what is known and what are the major scientific gaps. Study metrics were regional species richness, numbers of endemic and alien species, numbers of species identification guides and taxonomic experts, and a state-of- knowledge index. The threats to biodiver- sity were classified across the regions. A poor to moderate correlation between species richness and seabed area, and sea volume, and no correlations with topo- graphicvariation,wereattributedto sparse, uneven and unrepresentative sam- pling in much of the global marine environment. Many habitats have been poorly sampled, particularly in deeper seas, and several species-rich taxonomic groups, especially of smaller organisms, remain poorly studied. Crustacea, Mollus- ca, and Pisces comprised approximately half of all known species across the regions. The proportion that these and other taxa comprised of all taxa varied sufficiently to question whether the relative number of species within phyla and classes are constant throughout the world. Over- fishing and pollution were identified as the main threats to biodiversity across all regions, followed by alien species, altered temperature, acidification, and hypoxia, although their relative importance varied among regions. The findings were repli- cated worldwide, in both developed and developing countries: i.e. major gaps exist in sampling effort and taxonomic expertise that impair society\u2019s ability to discover new species and identify and understand species of economic and ecological impor- tance. There was a positive relationship between the availability of species identi- fication guides and knowledge of biodiver- sity, including the number of species and alien species. Available taxonomic guides and experts correlated negatively with endemic species, suggesting that the more we study the ocean the fewer endemic species are evident. There is a need to accelerate the discovery of marine biodi- versity, since much of it may be lost without even being known. We discuss how international collaboration between developed and developing countries is essential for improving productivity in the discovery and management of marine biodiversity, and how various sectors may contribute to this.", "title": "A Census of Marine Biodiversity Knowledge, Resources, and Future Challenges", "query": "A Census of Marine Biodiversity Knowledge, Resources, and Future Challenges"}

Here we review the science themes that benefit from data supplied from ocean observatories. Understanding from existing studies is fragmented to the extent that it lacks the coherent long-term monitoring needed to address questions at the scales essential to understand climate change and improve geo-hazard early warning. Data sets from the deep sea are particularly rare with long-term data available from only a few locations worldwide. These science areas have impacts on societal health and well-being and our awareness of ocean function in a shifting climate. Substantial efforts are underway to realise a network of open-ocean observatories around European Seas that will operate over multiple decades. Some systems are already collecting high-resolution data from surface, water column, seafloor, and sub-seafloor sensors linked to shore by satellite or cable connection in real or near-real time, along with samples and other data collected in a delayed mode. We expect that such observatories will contribute to answering major ocean science questions including: How can monitoring of factors such as seismic activity, pore fluid chemistry and pressure, and gas hydrate stability improve seismic, slope failure, and tsunami warning? What aspects of physical oceanography, biogeochemical cycling, and ecosystems will be most sensitive to climatic and anthropogenic change? What are natural versus anthropogenic changes? Most fundamentally, how are marine processes that occur at differing scales related? The development of ocean observatories provides a substantial opportunity for ocean science to evolve in Europe. Here we also describe some basic attributes of network design. Observatory networks provide the means to coordinate and integrate the collection of standardised data capable of bridging measurement scales across a dispersed area in European Seas adding needed certainty to estimates of future oceanic conditions. Observatory data can be analysed along with other data such as those from satellites, drifting floats, autonomous underwater vehicles, model analysis, and the known distribution and abundances of marine fauna in order to address some of the questions posed above. Standardised methods for information management are also becoming established to ensure better accessibility and traceability of these data sets and ultimately to increase their use for societal benefit. The connection of ocean observatory effort into larger frameworks including the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) and the Global Monitoring of Environment and Security (GMES) is integral to its success. It is in a greater integrated framework that the full potential of the component systems will be realised.", "title": "Societal need for improved understanding of climate change, anthropogenic impacts, and geo-hazard warning drive development of ocean observatories in European Seas", "query": "Societal need for improved understanding of climate change, anthropogenic impacts, and geo-hazard warning drive development of ocean observatories in European Seas"}

Most notable is the treatment o f horizontal discretisation which has undergone transition from a staggered Egrid to an orthogonal curvilinear C-grid. The treatment of subgridscale mixing has been improved by the inclusion of a new formulation of bottom boundary layer (BBL) slope convection, an isopycnal di usion scheme, and a Gent and McWilliams style eddy-induced mixing parameterisation. The model setup described here has a north pole over Greenland and a south pole on the coast of the Weddell Sea. This gives relatively high resolution in the sinking regions associated with the thermohaline circulation. Results are presented from a 450 year climatologically forced integration. The forcing is a product of the German Ocean Model Intercomparison Project and is derived from the ECMWF re-analysis. The main emphasis is on the model's representation of key quantities that are easily associated with the ocean's role in the global climate system. The global and Atlantic northward poleward heat transports have peaks of 1.43 and 0.84 PW, at 18 and 21 N respectively. The Atlantic meridional overturning streamfunction has a peak of 15.7 Sv in the North Atlantic and an out ow o f 1 1 . 9 S v a t 3 0 S. Comparison with a simulation excluding BBL shows that the scheme is responsible for up to a 25% increase in North Atlantic heat transport, with signi cant i m p r o vement of the depths of convection in the Greenland, Labrador and Irminger Seas. Despite the improvements, comparison with observations shows the heat transport still to be too weak. Other outstanding problems include an incorrect Gulf Stream pathway, a too strong Antarctic Circumpolar Current, and a too weak renewal of Antarctic Intermediate Water.

Increases in OA and OW may negatively affect the growth and survival of reef corals.In the present study, we separately examined the effects of OW and OA on the corals Acropora digitifera and Montipora digitata, which are dominant coral species occurring along the Ryukyu Archipelago, Japan, at three temperatures (28 \u2022 C, 30 \u2022 C, and 32 \u2022 C) and following four pCO 2 treatments (400, 600, 800, and 1,000 \u00b5atm) in aquarium experiments. In the OW experiment, the calcification rate (p = 0.02), endosymbiont density, and maximum photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm) (both p < 0.0001) decreased significantly at the highest temperature (32 \u2022 C) compared to those at the lower temperatures (28 \u2022 C and 30 \u2022 C) in both species. In the OA experiment, the calcification rate decreased significantly as pCO 2 increased (p < 0.0001), whereas endosymbiont density, chlorophyll content, and Fv/Fm were not affected. The calcification rate of A. digitifera showed greater decreases from 30 \u2022 C to 32 \u2022 C than that of M. digitata. The calcification of the two species responded differently to OW and OA. These results suggest that A. digitifera is more sensitive to OW than M. digitata, whereas M. digitata is more sensitive to OA. Thus, differences in the sensitivity of the two coral species to OW and OA might be attributed to differences in the endosymbiont species and high calcification rates, respectively.", "title": "Responses of branching reef corals Acropora digitifera and Montipora digitata to elevated temperature and pCO2", "query": "Responses of branching reef corals Acropora digitifera and Montipora digitata to elevated temperature and pCO2"}

This is tested with a sensitivity study using an ad hoc parameterization of wind stirring in an ocean carbon cycle model, where the objective is to identify the way in which perturbations to the vertical density structure of the planetary boundary in the ocean impacts the carbon cycle and ocean biogeochemistry.Wind stirring leads to reduced uptake of CO 2 by the Southern Ocean over the period 2000-2006, with a relative reduction with wind stirring on the order of 0.9 Pg C yr \u22121 over the region south of 45 \u2022 S. This impacts not only the mean carbon uptake, but also the phasing of the seasonal cycle of carbon and other ocean biogeochemical tracers. Enhanced wind stirring delays the seasonal onset of stratification, and this has large impacts on both entrainment and the biological pump. It is also found that there is a strong reduction on the order of 25-30 % in the concentrations of NO 3 exported in Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW) to wind stirring. This finds expression not only locally over the Southern Ocean, but also over larger scales through the impact on advected nutri-ents. In summary, the large sensitivity identified with the ad hoc wind stirring parameterization offers support for the importance of wind stirring for global ocean biogeochemistry through its impact over the Southern Ocean.", "title": "Strong sensitivity of Southern Ocean carbon uptake and nutrient cycling to wind stirring", "query": "Strong sensitivity of Southern Ocean carbon uptake and nutrient cycling to wind stirring"}

The oldest, most recalcitrant forms of DOC, which make up most of oceanic DOC, can be recovered by solid-phase extraction. Here we present measurements of solid-phase extractable DOC from samples collected between 2009 and 2013 at seven vent sites in the Atlantic, Pacific and Southern oceans, along with magnesium concentrations, a conservative tracer of water circulation through hydrothermal systems. We find that magnesium and solid-phase extractable DOC concentrations are correlated, suggesting that solid-phase extractable DOC is almost entirely lost from solution through mineralization or deposition during circulation through hydrothermal vents with fluid temperatures of 212\u2013401 \u00b0C. In laboratory experiments, where we heated samples to 380 \u00b0C for four days, we found a similar removal efficiency.

In sticklebacks, the successive duplication of a mucin gene (MUC19) into a tandemly arrayed, multigene family has enabled the production of copious amounts of 'spiggin', a secreted adhesive protein essential for nest construction. Here, we examine divergence between spiggin genes among three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) from ancestral marine and derived freshwater populations, and propose underpinning gene duplication mechanisms. Sanger sequencing revealed substantial diversity among spiggin transcripts, including alternatively spliced variants and interchromosomal spiggin chimeric genes. Comparative analysis of the sequenced transcripts and all other spiggin genes in the public domain support the presence of three main spiggin lineages (spiggin A, spiggin B and spiggin C) with further subdivisions within spiggin B (B1, B2) and spiggin C (C1, C2). Spiggin A had diverged least from the ancestral MUC19, while the spiggin C duplicates had diversified most substantially. In silico translations of the spiggin gene open reading frames predicted that spiggins A and B are secreted as long mucin-like polymers, while spiggins C1 and C2 are secreted as short monomers, with putative antimicrobial properties.

These clouds were dominated by supercooled liquid water droplets, which had a median concentration of 113 cm \u22123 and an interquartile range of 86 cm \u22123 . Both cloud liquid water content and effective radius increased closer to cloud top. The cloud droplet effective radius increased from 4 \u00b1 2 \u00b5m near cloud base to 8 \u00b1 3 \u00b5m near cloud top.Cloud ice particle concentrations were highly variable with the ice tending to occur in small, isolated patches. Below approximately 1000 m, glaciated cloud regions were more common at higher temperatures; however, the clouds were still predominantly liquid throughout. When ice was present at temperatures higher than \u221210 \u2022 C, secondary ice production most likely through the Hallett-Mossop mechanism led to ice concentrations 1 to 3 orders of magnitude higher than the number predicted by commonly used primary ice nucleation parameterisations. The drivers of the ice crystal variability are investigated. No clear dependence on the droplet size distribution was found. The source of first ice in the clouds remains uncertain but may include contributions from biogenic particles, blowing snow or other surface ice production mechanisms.The concentration of large aerosols (diameters 0.5 to 1.6 \u00b5m) decreased with altitude and were depleted in air masses that originated over the Antarctic continent compared to those more heavily influenced by the Southern Ocean and sea ice regions. The dominant aerosol in the region was hygroscopic in nature, with the hygroscopicity parameter \u03ba having a median value for the campaign of 0.66 (interquartile range of 0.38).

Here, we present estimates of ben- thic foraminiferal denitri\ufb01cation rates from six stations at in- termediate water depths in and below the Peruvian oxygen minimum zone (OMZ).

A comparison with total benthic denitri\ufb01- cation rates as inferred by biogeochemical models revealed that benthic foraminifera probably account for the total den- itri\ufb01cation in shelf sediments between 80 and 250 m water depth. The estimations also imply that foraminifera are still important denitri\ufb01ers in the centre of the OMZ around 320 m (29\u201350 % of the benthic denitri\ufb01cation), but play only a mi- nor role at the lower OMZ boundary and below the OMZ between 465 and 700 m (2\u20136 % of total benthic denitri\ufb01- cation).

The estimated foraminiferal denitri\ufb01cation rates contribute 2 to 46 % to the total nitrate loss across a depth transect from 80 to 700 m, respectively.

Furthermore we show that the amount of nitrate stored in liv- ing benthic foraminifera (3 to 3955 \u00b5mol L\u22121) can be higher by three orders of magnitude as compared to the ambient pore waters in near-surface sediments sustaining an impor- tant nitrate reservoir in Peruvian OMZ sediments. The sub- stantial contribution of foraminiferal nitrate respiration to to- tal benthic nitrate loss at the Peruvian margin, which is one of the main nitrate sink regions in the world ocean, underpins the importance of the previously underestimated role of ben- thic foraminifera in global biogeochemical cycles.", "title": "The role of benthic foraminifera in the benthic nitrogen cycle of the Peruvian oxygen minimum zone", "query": "The role of benthic foraminifera in the benthic nitrogen cycle of the Peruvian oxygen minimum zone"}

Many studies are available regarding the relation between dietary saturated fats and the etiology of obesity, but most focus on liver, muscle and white adipose tissue. Furthermore, the majority of transcriptomic studies seek to identify linear effects of an external stimulus on gene expression, although such an assumption does not necessarily hold. Our work assesses the dose-dependent effects of dietary fat intake on differential gene expression in the proximal, middle and distal sections of the small intestine in C57BL/6J mice. Gene expression is analyzed in terms of either linear or nonlinear responses to fat intake.Results:The highest number of differentially expressed genes was observed in the middle section. In all intestine sections, most of the identified processes exhibited a linear response to increasing fat intake. The relative importance of logarithmic and exponential responses was higher in the proximal and distal sections, respectively. Functional enrichment analysis highlighted a constantly linear regulation of acute-phase response along the whole small intestine, with upregulation of Serpina1b. The study of gene expression showed that exponential down-regulation of cholesterol transport in the middle section is coupled with logarithmic up-regulation of cholesterol homeostasis. A shift from linear to exponential response was observed in genes involved in the negative regulation of caspase activity, from middle to distal section (e.g., Birc5, up-regulated).Conclusions:The transcriptomic signature associated with inflammatory processes preserved a linear response in the whole small intestine (e.g., up-regulation of Serpina1b). Processes related to cholesterol homeostasis were particularly active in the middle small intestine and only the highest fat intake down-regulated cholesterol transport and efflux (with a key role played by the down-regulation of ATP binding cassette transporters). Characterization of nonlinear patterns of gene expression triggered by different levels of dietary fat is an absolute novelty in intestinal studies. This approach helps identifying which processes are overloaded (i.e., positive, logarithmic regulation) or arrested (i.e., negative, exponential regulation) in response to excessive fat intake, and can shed light on the relationships linking lipid intake to obesity and its associated molecular disturbances.", "title": "Nonlinear transcriptomic response to dietary fat intake in the small intestine of C57BL/6J mice", "query": "Nonlinear transcriptomic response to dietary fat intake in the small intestine of C57BL/6J mice"}

To investigate the potential effects of ocean acidification on the early life stages of a commercially important fish species, European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), 12 000 larvae were incubated from hatch through metamorphosis under a matrix of two temperatures (17 and 19 \u2022 C) and two seawater pCO 2 levels (ambient and 1,000 \u00b5atm) and sampled regularly for 42 days. Calculated daily mortality was significantly affected by both temperature and pCO 2 , with both increased temperature and elevated pCO 2 associated with lower daily mortality and a significant interaction between these two factors. There was no significant pCO 2 effect noted on larval morphology during this period but larvae raised at 19 \u2022 C possessed significantly larger eyes and lower carbon:nitrogen ratios at the end of the study compared to those raised under 17 \u2022 C. Similarly, when the incubation was continued to post-metamorphic (juvenile) animals (day 67-69), fish raised under a combination of 19 \u2022 C and 1000 \u00b5atm pCO 2 were significantly heavier. However, juvenile D. labrax raised under this combination of 19 \u2022 C and 1000 \u00b5atm pCO 2 also exhibited lower aerobic scopes than those incubated at 19 \u2022 C and ambient pCO 2 . Most studies investigating the effects of near-future oceanic conditions on the early life stages of marine fish have used incubations of relatively short durations and suggested that these animals are resilient to ocean acidification. Whilst the increased survival and growth observed in this study supports this view, we conclude that more work is required to investigate whether the differences in juvenile physiology observed in this study manifest as negative impacts in adult fish.", "title": "European sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax, in a changing ocean", "query": "European sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax, in a changing ocean"}

In the Mediterranean Sea, the management of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) is rarely based on explicit consideration of the distribution of multiple stressors, with direct assessment of their effects on ecosystems. This gap limits the effectiveness of protection and is conducive to conflicts among stakeholders. Here, a fine scale assessment of the potential effects of different combinations of stressors (both land-and marine-based) on vulnerable rocky habitats (i.e. lower midlittoral and shallow infralittoral) along 40 km of coast in the western Mediterranean (Ionian Sea) has been carried out. The study area is a paradigmatic example of socio-ecological interactions, where several human uses and conservation measures collide. Significant differences in the structure of assemblages according to different combinations of threats were observed, indicating distinct responses of marine habitats to different sets of human pressures. A more complex three-dimensional structure, higher taxon richness and \u03b2-diversity characterized assemblages subject to low versus high levels of human pressure, consistently across habitats. In addition, the main drivers of change were: closeness to the harbour, water quality, and the relative extension of beaches. Our findings suggest that, although efforts to assess cumulative impacts at large scale may help in individuating priority areas for conservation purposes, the fact that such evaluations are often based on expert opinions and not on actual studies limits their ability to represent real environmental conditions at local scale. Systematic evaluations of local scale effects of anthropogenic drivers of change on biological communities should complement broad scale management strategies to achieve effective sustainability of human exploitation of marine resources.", "title": "The Challenge of Planning Conservation Strategies in Threatened Seascapes: Understanding the Role of Fine Scale Assessments of Community Response to Cumulative Human Pressures", "query": "The Challenge of Planning Conservation Strategies in Threatened Seascapes: Understanding the Role of Fine Scale Assessments of Community Response to Cumulative Human Pressures"}

The WAGHC climatology is based on the quality controlled temperature and salinity profiles obtained before January 2016, and the average climatological year is in the range from 2008 to 2012.To avoid biases due to the significant step-like decrease of the data below 2 km, the profile extrapolation procedure is implemented.

Its non-calcifying, haploid life-cycle stage was found to be relatively unaffected by OA with respect to biomass production. Deeper insights into physiological key processes and their dependence on environmental factors are lacking, but are required to understand and possibly estimate the dynamics of carbon cycling in present and future oceans. Therefore, calcifying diploid and noncalcifying haploid cells were acclimated to present and future CO 2 partial pressures (pCO 2 ; 38.5 Pa vs. 101.3 Pa CO 2 ) under low and high light (50 vs. 300 mmol photons m 22 s 21 ). Comparative microarray-based transcriptome profiling was used to screen for the underlying cellular processes and allowed to follow up interpretations derived from physiological data. In the diplont, the observed increases in biomass production under OA are likely caused by stimulated production of glycoconjugates and lipids. The observed lowered calcification under OA can be attributed to impaired signal-transduction and ion-transport. The haplont utilizes distinct genes and metabolic pathways, reflecting the stage-specific usage of certain portions of the genome. With respect to functionality and energy-dependence, however, the transcriptomic OA-responses resemble those of the diplont. In both life-cycle stages, OA affects the cellular redox-state as a master regulator and thereby causes a metabolic shift from oxidative towards reductive pathways, which involves a reconstellation of carbon flux networks within and across compartments. Whereas signal transduction and ion-homeostasis appear equally OA-sensitive under both light intensities, the effects on carbon metabolism and light physiology are clearly modulated by light availability. These interactive effects can be attributed to the influence of OA and light on the redox equilibria of NAD and NADP, which function as major sensors for energization and stress. This generic mode of action of OA may therefore provoke similar cell-physiological responses in other protists.", "title": "Ocean Acidification Affects Redox-Balance and Ion-Homeostasis in the Life-Cycle Stages of Emiliania huxleyi", "query": "Ocean Acidification Affects Redox-Balance and Ion-Homeostasis in the Life-Cycle Stages of Emiliania huxleyi"}

One mechanism of resilience to ocean acidification is an organism\u00d5s ability to regulate pH and, thus, calcium carbonate saturation state, at its site of calcification. This mechanism has received detailed study in scleractinian corals but is relatively understudied in other taxonomic groups that are vulnerable to ocean acidification, such as bivalves. Here, the results of a 74-day controlled laboratory experiment investigating the impact of ocean acidification on the extrapallial fluid (EPF; the bivalve calcifying fluid) pH, calcification rate, and condition factor of the king scallop Pecten maximus at their average spring and summer temperatures (362 ppm/9.0\u00b0C, 454 ppm/12.3\u00b0C; 860 ppm/9.0\u00b0C, 946 ppm/12.3\u00b0C; 2,639 ppm/8.9\u00b0C, 2,750 ppm/12.1\u00b0C) are presented. Scallop EPF pH was lower than seawater pH in all treatments and declined with increasing pCO 2 under the spring temperature (9\u00b0C) but was uncorrelated with pCO 2 under the summer temperature (12\u00b0C). Furthermore, king scallop calcification rate and EPF pH were inversely correlated at 9\u00b0C and uncorrelated at 12\u00b0C. This inverse correlation between EPF pH and scallop calcification rate, combined with the observation that scallop EPF pH is consistently lower than seawater pH, suggests that pH regulation is not the sole mechanism by which scallops concentrate carbonate ions for calcification within their EPF. Calcification trends contrasted most other published studies on bivalves, increasing with ocean acidification under spring temperature and exhibiting no response to ocean acidification under summer temperature. Scallop condition factor exhibited no response to ocean acidification under spring temperature but increased with ocean acidification under summer temperature-exactly the opposite of their calcification response to ocean acidification. These results suggest that king scallops are relatively resilient to CO 2 -induced ocean acidification, but that their allocation of resources between tissue and shell production in response to this stressor varies seasonally.", "title": "Effects of Temperature and Ocean Acidification on the Extrapallial Fluid pH, Calcification Rate, and Condition Factor of the King Scallop Pecten maximus", "query": "Effects of Temperature and Ocean Acidification on the Extrapallial Fluid pH, Calcification Rate, and Condition Factor of the King Scallop Pecten maximus"}

The 12 km wide lake is sited off-centre in an 18 km large crater that was created by the impact of a meteorite 3.58 Ma ago. Since then sediments have been continuously deposited. For establishing their chronology, major reversals of the earth's magnetic field provided initial tie points for the age model, confirming that the impact occurred in the earliest geomagnetic Gauss chron. Various stratigraphic parameters, reflecting redox conditions at the lake floor and climatic conditions in the catchment were tuned synchronously to Northern Hemisphere insolation variations and the marine oxygen isotope stack, respectively. Thus, a robust age model comprising more than 600 tie points could be defined. It could be shown that deposition of sediments in Lake El'gygytgyn occurred in concert with global climatic cycles. The upper \u223c 160 m of sediments represent the past 3.3 Ma, equivalent to sedimentation rates of 4 to 5 cm ka \u22121 , whereas the lower 160 m represent just the first 0.3 Ma after the impact, equivalent to sedimentation rates in the order of 45 cm ka \u22121 .

The main goals of this work were to be able to predict the regional distribution of the air-sea fluxes of DMS and to predict eventually their future evolution with climate change. Diagnostic relationships have been established from data sets obtained during the ALBATROSS and EUMELI cruises carried out in the Atlantic Ocean. These equations nonlinearly relate DMS and pDMSP concentrations to chlorophyll concentrations and to the trophic status of surface waters. This model has been embedded in the global ocean carbon cycle model Institut Pierre et Simon Laplace-Ocean Carbon Cycle Model version 2 (ISPL-OCCM2), a simple plankton model coupled to a global three-dimensional ocean general circulation model. Predicted global distributions and seasonal variations of surface chlorophyll are in good agreement with the observations, except in the equatorial Pacific Ocean and, to a lesser extent, in the Southern Ocean. In these regions, simulated surface chlorophyll concentrations are strongly overestimated, most likely because limitations of the biological production by nutrients like iron or silicate are not considered. The model predicts surface DMS and pDMSP concentrations, which compare reasonably well with the observations. However, in the high latitudes, seasonal variations are underestimated, especially in the Ross and Weddell Seas where observed very elevated concentrations of DMS due to spring and summer blooms of Phaeocystis cannot be reproduced by the model. The global annual flux of DMS predicted by lPSL-OCCM2 ranges from 17 to 26.7 Tg S yr \u00c01 depending on the formulation for gas exchange coefficient. About one third of this flux is located in the subtropical/subpolar frontal zone of the Southern Ocean, which plays a critical role in the sulfur cycle. Furthermore, model results suggest that the Southern Ocean, south of the Polar Front, could be a rather modest source of DMS for the atmosphere.", "title": "Dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) and dimethylsulfide (DMS) sea surface distributions simulated from a global three-dimensional ocean carbon cycle model", "query": "Dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) and dimethylsulfide (DMS) sea surface distributions simulated from a global three-dimensional ocean carbon cycle model"}

Here, by summarizing identified key roles of 24 the bottom boundary and highlighting persistent knowledge gaps, we overturn the common surface-centric perception of the ocean and encourage new observational efforts to unveil and 26 quantify bottom ocean phenomena. Without such efforts, we expect that bottom processes will stand as a narrowing bottleneck in our understanding of the ocean\u2019s role in climate. 28 Accelerated by surface wind and thermohaline forcing or by tidal forces, oceanic flows rely 30 largely on interactions with the slopes and roughness of the bottom topography for their ultimate arrest8,3-5. Though they set the energy and momentum balance of the ocean, these near-bottom 32 dissipative processes remain rather poorly known, some of them still lacking identification or understanding and most of them lacking accurate quantification8,9. The lack of a reliable closure 34 of momentum and energy budgets hampers in turn our ability to describe and model the flow of heat and other climatically important tracers across the oceans, both within deep and upper layers. 36 In particular, the concentration of energy dissipation along the bottom boundary is a key 38 determinant of the large-scale distribution of ocean properties, and of the rate at which the atmosphere and the deep ocean heat and carbon reservoirs communicate. The dissipation of 40 oceanic flows is synonymous to a transfer of their kinetic energy to small-scale turbulence through various instabilities. The resulting turbulent mixing redistributes seawater properties, 42 balancing local transports by ocean currents and, more fundamentally, global sources and sinks through the ocean\u2019s surface and bottom boundaries. The seafloor-catalysed energy dissipation is 44 thus tied to elevated turbulent mixing rates, typically concentrated within the bottom few percents", "title": "Getting to the bottom of the ocean", "query": "Getting to the bottom of the ocean"}

Analysis of hatchery strain admixture proportions showed that in one wild population, two of the loci showed significantly lower admixture proportions than the putatively neutral loci, implying contemporary selection against alleles introduced by hatchery strain trout. In the most strongly admixed population, however, there was no evidence for selection, possibly because of immigration by stocked trout overcoming selection against hatchery-derived alleles or supportive breeding practices allowing hatchery strain trout to escape natural selection.

(Delile), affecting its resilience, or capability to restore the physiological homeostasis, and the nutritional quality of organic matter available for grazers. Seawater acidification decreased the C to N ratio in P. oceanica tissues and increased grazing rate, shoot density, leaf proteins and asparagine accumulation in rhizomes, while the maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II was unaffected. The 13C-dilution in both structural and non-structural C metabolites in the acidified site indicated quali-quantitative changes of C source and/or increased isotopic fractionation during C uptake and carboxylation associated with the higher CO2 level. The decreased C:N ratio in the acidified site suggests an increased N availability, leading to a greater storage of 15N-enriched compounds in rhizomes. The amount of the more dynamic C storage form, sucrose, decreased in rhizomes of the acidified site in response to the enhanced energy demand due to higher shoot recruitment and N compound synthesis, without affecting starch reserves.

These lipids are a major component of dust, even in remote ocean areas, and have a predominantly aeolian origin in distal marine sediments. Our results demonstrate that around 2.7 million years ago (Ma), coinciding with the intensification of the Northern Hemisphere glaciation (NHG), the aeolian input of terrestrial material to the North Atlantic increased drastically. Since then, during every glacial the aeolian input of higher plant material was up to 30 times higher than during interglacials. The close correspondence between aeolian input to the North Atlantic and other dust records indicates a globally uniform response of dust sources to Quaternary climate variability, although the amplitude of variation differs among areas. We argue that the increased aeolian input at Site U1313 during glacials is predominantly related to the episodic appearance of continental ice sheets in North America and the associated strengthening of glaciogenic dust sources. Evolutional spectral analyses of the n-alkane records were therefore used to determine the dominant astronomical forcing in North American ice sheet advances. These results demonstrate that during the early Pleistocene North American ice sheet dynamics responded predominantly to variations in obliquity (41 ka), which argues against previous suggestions of precession-related variations in Northern Hemisphere ice sheets during the early Pleistocene.", "title": "Strengthening of North American dust sources during the late Pliocene (2.7Ma)", "query": "Strengthening of North American dust sources during the late Pliocene (2.7Ma)"}

In this study, we discuss the predictability of the main ocean current system in the region, the subpolar gyre. From perfect model hindcasts exploiting initial condition information only from realistic ocean observation locations, we find that predictability is increased when Argo subsurface data are included.

High latitudes, especially the Arctic, will be the first to encounter profound changes in carbonate chemistry speciation at a large scale, namely the under-saturation of surface waters with respect to aragonite, a calcium carbonate polymorph produced by several organisms in this region. During a CO 2 perturbation study in Kongsfjorden on the west coast of Spitsbergen (Norway), in the framework of the EU-funded project EPOCA, the temporal dynamics of a plankton bloom was followed in nine mesocosms, manipulated for CO 2 levels ranging initially from about 185 to 1420 \u00b5atm. Dissolved inorganic nutrients were added halfway through the experiment. Autotrophic biomass, as identified by chlorophyll a standing stocks (Chl a), peaked three times in all mesocosms. However, while absolute Chl a concentrations were similar in all mesocosms during the first phase of the experiment, higher autotrophic biomass was measured as high in comparison to low CO 2 during the second phase, right after dissolved inorganic nutrient addition. This trend then reversed in the third phase. There were several statistically significant CO 2 effects on a variety of parameters measured in certain phases, such as nutrient utilization, standing stocks of particulate organic matter, and phytoplankton species composition. Interestingly, CO 2 effects de-veloped slowly but steadily, becoming more and more statistically significant with time. The observed CO 2 -related shifts in nutrient flow into different phytoplankton groups (mainly dinoflagellates, prasinophytes and haptophytes) could have consequences for future organic matter flow to higher trophic levels and export production, with consequences for ecosystem productivity and atmospheric CO 2 .", "title": "Temporal biomass dynamics of an Arctic plankton bloom in response to increasing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide", "query": "Temporal biomass dynamics of an Arctic plankton bloom in response to increasing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide"}

The role of individual T. weissflogii-attaching and free-living new bacterial isolates for TEP production and diatom aggregation was investigated in vitro.

The data indicated that free-living bacteria might not influence aggregation whereas bacteria attaching to diatom cells may increase aggregate formation. Interestingly, photosynthetically inactivated T. weissflogii cells did not aggregate regardless of the presence of bacteria. Comparison of aggregate formation, TEP production, aggregate sinking velocity and solid hydrated density revealed remarkable differences. Both, photosynthetically active T. weissflogii and specific diatom-attaching bacteria were required for aggregation.

These processes impact light penetration and primary production. To reach a better understanding of the current status and to provide accurate forecasts Arctic biogeochemical and physical parameters need to be extensively monitored. In this sense, bio-optical properties are useful to be measured due to the applicability of optical instrumentation to autonomous platforms, including satellites. This study characterizes the non-water absorbers and their coupling to hydrographic conditions in the poorly sampled surface waters of the central and eastern Arctic Ocean. Over the entire sampled area colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) dominates the light absorption in surface waters. The distribution of CDOM, phytoplankton and non-algal particles absorption reproduces the hydrographic variability in this region of the Arctic Ocean which suggests a subdivision into five major bio-optical provinces: Laptev Sea Shelf, Laptev Sea, Central Arctic/Transpolar Drift, Beaufort Gyre and Eurasian/Nansen Basin. Evaluating ocean color algorithms commonly applied in the Arctic Ocean shows that global and regionally tuned empirical algorithms provide poor chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) estimates. The semi-analytical algorithms Generalized Inherent Optical Property model (GIOP) and Garver-Siegel-Maritorena (GSM), on the other hand, provide robust estimates of Chl-a and absorption of colored matter. Applying GSM with modifications proposed for the western Arctic Ocean produced reliable information on the absorption by colored matter, and specifically by CDOM. These findings highlight that only semi-analytical ocean color algorithms are able to identify with low uncertainty the distribution of the different optical water constituents in these high CDOM absorbing waters. In addition, a clustering of the Arctic Ocean into bio-optical provinces will help to develop and then select province-specific ocean color algorithms. \u00a9 2018 Gon\u00e7alves-Araujo et al.

However, a hydrogenase gene cluster (encoding the hydrogen converting enzyme and its maturation/assembly machinery) detected on the first sequenced H. crunogenus strain (XCL-2) suggested that hydrogen conversion may also play a role in this organism. Yet, numerous experiments have underlined XCL-2's inability to consume hydrogen under the tested conditions. A recent study showed that the closely related strain SP-41 contains a homolog of the XCL-2 hydrogenase (a group 1b [NiFe]-hydrogenase), but that it can indeed use hydrogen. Hence, the question remained unresolved, why SP-41 is capable of using hydrogen, while XCL-2 is not.Results: Here, we present the genome sequence of the SP-41 strain and compare it to that of the XCL-2 strain. We show that the chromosome of SP-41 codes for a further hydrogenase gene cluster, including two additional hydrogenases: the first appears to be a group 1d periplasmic membrane-anchored hydrogenase, and the second a group 2b sensory hydrogenase. The region where these genes are located was likely acquired horizontally and exhibits similarity to other Hydrogenovibrio species (H. thermophilus MA2-6 and H. marinus MH-110 T ) and other hydrogen oxidizing Proteobacteria (Cupriavidus necator H16 and Ghiorsea bivora TAG-1 T ). The genomes of XCL-2 and SP-41 show a strong conservation in gene order. However, several short genomic regions are not contained in the genome of the other strain. These exclusive regions are often associated with signs of DNA mobility, such as genes coding for transposases. They code for transport systems and/or extend the metabolic potential of the strains.

We tested how much the phenotypic responses of strains from the same Arctic diatom population diverge and whether the physiology and intraspecific composition of multistrain populations differs from expectations based on single strain traits. To this end, we conducted incubation experiments with the diatom Thalassiosira hyalina under present-day and future temperature and pCO 2 treatments. Six fresh isolates from the same Svalbard population were incubated as mono-and multistrain cultures. For the first time, we were able to closely follow intraspecific selection within an artificial population using microsatellites and allele-specific quantitative PCR. Our results showed not only that there is substantial variation in how strains of the same species cope with the tested environments but also that changes in genotype composition, production rates, and cellular quotas in the multistrain cultures are not predictable from monoculture performance.Nevertheless, the physiological responses as well as strain composition of the artificial populations were highly reproducible within each environment. Interestingly, we only detected significant strain sorting in those populations exposed to the future treatment. This study illustrates that the genetic composition of populations can change on very short timescales through selection from the intraspecific standing stock, indicating the potential for rapid population level adaptation to climate change.We further show that individuals adjust their phenotype not only in response to their physicochemical but also to their biological surroundings. Such intraspecific interactions need to be understood in order to realistically predict ecosystem responses to global change.", "title": "Company matters: The presence of other genotypes alters traits and intraspecific selection in an Arctic diatom under climate change", "query": "Company matters: The presence of other genotypes alters traits and intraspecific selection in an Arctic diatom under climate change"}

The few experiments to date have been short-term (b 1 year) and reveal mixed responses depending on the species examined and the culture conditions used. It is difficult to carry out long-term manipulations of CO 2 levels, therefore areas with naturally high CO 2 levels are being used to help understand which species, habitats and processes are resilient to the effects of ocean acidification, and which are adversely affected. Here we describe the effects of increasing CO 2 levels on macroalgal communities along a pH gradient caused by volcanic vents. Macroalgal habitat differed at taxonomic and morphological group levels along a pH gradient. The vast majority of the 101 macroalgal species studied were able to grow with only a 5% decrease in species richness as the mean pH fell from 8.1 to 7.8. However, this small fall in species richness was associated with shifts in community structure as the cover of turf algae decreased disproportionately. Calcitic species were significantly reduced in cover and species richness whereas a few non-calcified species became dominant. At mean pH 6.7, where carbonate saturation levels were b 1, calcareous species were absent and there was a 72% fall in species richness. Under these extremely high CO 2 conditions a few species dominated the simplified macroalgal assemblage and a very few exhibited enhanced reproduction, although high CO 2 levels seemed to inhibit reproduction in others. Our data show that many macroalgal species are tolerant of long-term elevations in CO 2 levels but that macroalgal habitats are altered significantly as pH drops, contributing to a scant but growing body of evidence concerning the long-term effects of CO 2 emissions in vegetated marine systems. Further study is now needed to investigate whether the observed response of macroalgal communities can be replicated in different seasons and from a range of geographical regions for incorporation into global modelling studies to predict effects of CO 2 emissions on Earth's ecosystems.", "title": "Effects of ocean acidification on macroalgal communities", "query": "Effects of ocean acidification on macroalgal communities"}

This study characterizes the optical properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) within the Lena Delta region and evaluates the behavior of DOM across the fresh water-marine gradient. Six fluorescent components (four humic-like; one marine humic-like; one protein-like) were identified by Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) with a clear dominance of allochthonous humic-like signals. Colored DOM (CDOM) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were highly correlated and had their distribution coupled with hydrographical conditions. Higher DOM concentration and degree of humification were associated with the low salinity waters of the Lena River. Values decreased toward the higher salinity Laptev Sea shelf waters. Results demonstrate different responses of DOM mixing in relation to the vertical structure of the water column, as reflecting the hydrographical dynamics in the region. Two mixing curves for DOM were apparent. In surface waters above the pycnocline there was a sharper decrease in DOM concentration in relation to salinity indicating removal. In the bottom water layer the DOM decrease within salinity was less. We propose there is a removal of DOM occurring primarily at the surface layer, which is likely driven by photodegradation and flocculation.", "title": "From Fresh to Marine Waters: Characterization and Fate of Dissolved Organic Matter in the Lena River Delta Region, Siberia", "query": "From Fresh to Marine Waters: Characterization and Fate of Dissolved Organic Matter in the Lena River Delta Region, Siberia"}

Deep ocean organic carbon fluxes measured by sediment traps are also fairly high despite low biogenic opal fluxes. Due to a low supply of dissolved silicate from subsurface waters, the ocean off NW Africa is characterized by predominantly carbonatesecreting primary producers, i.e. coccolithophorids. These algae which are key primary producers since millions of years are found in organic-and chlorophyll-rich zooplankton fecal pellets, which sink rapidly through the water column within a few days. Particle flux studies in the Mauretanian upwelling area (Cape Blanc) confirm the hypothesis of Armstrong et al. (Deep Sea Res II 49:219-236, 2002) who proposed that ballast availability, e.g. of carbonate particles, is essential to predict deep ocean organic carbon fluxes. The role of dust as ballast mineral for organic carbon, however, must be also taken into consideration in the coastal settings off NW Africa. There, high settling rates of larger particles approach 400 m day \u00c01 , which may be due to a particular composition of mineral ballast. An assessment of particle settling rates from opal-production systems in the Southern Ocean of the Atlantic Sector, in contrast, provides lower values, consistent with the assumptions of Francois et al. (Global Biogeochem Cycles 16(4):1087, 2002). Satellite chlorophyll distributions, particle distributions and fluxes in the water column off NW Africa as well as modelling studies suggest a significant lateral flux component and export of particles from coastal shelf waters into the open ocean.

We reared laboratory-bred individuals (as singles or pairs), and field-collected assemblages of barnacles, at pH 8.1 and 7.5 (% 400 and 1600 \u03bcatm pCO 2 respectively) for up to 16 months. Acidification caused strong mortality and reduced growth rates. Acidification suppressed respiration rates and induced a higher feeding activity of barnacles after 6 months, but this suppression of respiration rate was absent after 15 months. Laboratorybred barnacles developed mature gonads only when they were held in pairs, but nonetheless failed to produce fertilized embryos. Field-collected barnacles reared in the laboratory for 8 months at the same pH's developed mature gonads, but only those in pH 8.1 produced viable embryos and larvae. Because survivors of long-term acidification were not capable of reproducing, this demonstrates that B. improvisus can only partially acclimate to long-term acidification.

Thus the deep water flow is of interest in the Bothnian Sea. In this study, we used Argo float data from six different long-term missions, from 111 to 512 days, to analyze the deep-water flow in the Bothnian Sea where no continuous monitoring of currents exist.

We analyzed the movements statistically and estimated the error caused by the surface drift of the floats during their stay at the surface by using 3D hydrodynamic model results as reference data. Our results show a northward flowing resultant current in the deep trench of the Bothnian Sea. There seemed to be very little exchange between coastal zone and open-sea waters in deeper layers.

In krill this involves partial digestion and resorption of the old exoskeleton and synthesis of new cuticle. Molecular events that underlie the moult cycle are poorly understood in calcifying crustaceans and even less so in non-calcifying organisms such as krill. To address this we constructed an Antarctic krill cDNA microarray in order to generate gene expression profiles across the moult cycle and identify possible activation pathways. Results: A total of 26 different cuticle genes were identified that showed differential gene expression across the moult cycle. Almost all cuticle genes were up regulated during premoult and down regulated during late intermoult. There were a number of transcripts with significant sequence homology to genes potentially involved in the synthesis, breakdown and resorption of chitin. During early premoult glutamine synthetase, a gene involved in generating an amino acid used in the synthesis of glucosamine, a constituent of chitin, was up regulated more than twofold. Mannosyltransferase 1, a member of the glycosyltransferase family of enzymes that includes chitin synthase was also up regulated during early premoult. Transcripts homologous to a \u03b2-N-acetylglucosaminidase (\u03b2-NAGase) precursor were expressed at a higher level during late intermoult (prior to apolysis) than during premoult. This observation coincided with the up regulation during late intermoult, of a coatomer subunit epsilon involved in the production of vesicles that maybe used to transport the \u03b2-NAGase precursors into the exuvial cleft. Trypsin, known to activate the \u03b2-NAGase precursor, was up regulated more than fourfold during premoult. The up regulation of a predicted oligopeptide transporter during premoult may allow the transport of chitin breakdown products across the newly synthesised epi-and exocuticle layers.Conclusion:We have identified many genes differentially expressed across the moult cycle of krill that correspond with known phenotypic structural changes. This study has provided a better understanding of the processes involved in krill moulting and how they may be controlled at the gene expression level.", "title": "Differential gene expression during the moult cycle of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba)", "query": "Differential gene expression during the moult cycle of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba)"}

The aragonite saturation threshold (\u03a9 a ) for calcification, respiration and organic matter fluxes were investigated experimentally in the Mediterranean Madrepora oculata. Over 10 weeks, colonies were maintained under two feeding regimes (uptake of 36.75 and 7.46 \u00b5mol C polyp \u22121 week \u22121 ) and exposed in 2 week intervals to a consecutively changing air-CO 2 mix ( pCO 2 ) of 400, 1600, 800, 2000 and 400 ppm. There was a significant effect of feeding on calcification at initial ambient pCO 2 , while with consecutive pCO 2 treatments, feeding had no effect on calcification. Respiration was not significantly affected by feeding or pCO 2 levels. Coral skeletons started to dissolve at an average \u03a9 a threshold of 0.92, but recovered and started to calcify again at \u03a9 a \u22651. The surplus energy required to counteract dissolution at elevated pCO 2 (\u22651600 \u00b5atm) was twice that at ambient pCO 2 . Yet, feeding had no mitigating effect at increasing pCO 2 levels. This could be due to the fact that the energy required for calcification is a small fraction (1-3%) of the total metabolic energy demand and corals even under low food conditions might therefore still be able to allocate this small portion of energy to calcification. The response and resistance to ocean acidification are consequently not controlled by feeding in this species, but more likely by chemical reactions at the site of calcification and exchange processes between the calicoblastic layer and ambient seawater.", "title": "Effects of elevated pCO2 and feeding on net calcification and energy budget of the Mediterranean cold-water coral Madrepora oculata", "query": "Effects of elevated pCO2 and feeding on net calcification and energy budget of the Mediterranean cold-water coral Madrepora oculata"}

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) may provide an alternative. The interpretation of SAR data for coastal erosion monitoring in Arctic regions is, however, challenging due to issues of viewing geometry, ambiguities in scattering behavior and inconsistencies in acquisition strategies. In order to assess SAR applicability, we have investigated data acquired at three different wavelengths (X-, C-, L-band; TerraSAR-X, Sentinel-1, ALOS PALSAR 1/2). In a first step we developed a pre-processing workflow which considers viewing geometry issues (shoreline orientation, incidence angle relationships with respect to different landcover types). We distinguish between areas with foreshortening along cliffs facing the sensor, radar shadow along cliffs facing away and traditional land-water boundary discrimination. Results are compared to retrievals from Landsat trends. Four regions which feature high erosion rates have been selected. All three wavelengths have been investigated for Kay Point (Canadian Beaufort Sea Coast). C-and L-band have been studied at all sites, including also Herschel Island (Canadian Beaufort Sea Coast), Varandai (Barents Sea Coast, Russia), and Bykovsky Peninsula (Laptev Sea coast, Russia). Erosion rates have been derived for a 1-year period (2017-2018) and in case of L-band also over 11 years (2007)(2008)(2009)(2010)(2011)(2012)(2013)(2014)(2015)(2016)(2017)(2018). Results indicate applicability of all wavelengths, but acquisitions need to be selected with care to deal with potential ambiguities in scattering behavior. Furthermore, incidence angle dependencies need to be considered for discrimination of the land-water boundary in case of L-and C-band. However, L-band has the lowest sensitivity to wave action and relevant future missions are expected to be of value for coastal erosion monitoring. The utilization of trends derived from Landsat is also promising for efficient long-term trend retrieval. The high spatial resolution of TerraSAR-X staring spot light mode (< 1 m) also allows the use of radar shadow for cliff-top monitoring in all seasons. Derived retreat rates agree with rates available from other data sources, but the applicability for automatic retrieval is partially limited. The derived rates suggest an increase of erosion at all four sites in recent years, but uncertainties are also high.", "title": "Feasibility Study for the Application of Synthetic Aperture Radar for Coastal Erosion Rate Quantification Across the Arctic", "query": "Feasibility Study for the Application of Synthetic Aperture Radar for Coastal Erosion Rate Quantification Across the Arctic"}

Comparative pathogenomics of these fungi is essential to understand Moniliophthora infection strategies, therefore the detection and in silico functional characterization of effector candidates are important steps to gain insight on their pathogenicity.Results: Candidate secreted effector proteins repertoire were predicted using the genomes of five representative isolates of M. perniciosa subpopulations (three from cacao and two from solanaceous hosts), and one representative isolate of M. roreri from Peru. Many putative effectors candidates were identified in M. perniciosa: 157 and 134 in cacao isolates from Bahia, Brazil; 109 in cacao isolate from Ecuador, 92 and 80 in wild solanaceous isolates from Minas Gerais (Lobeira) and Bahia (Cai\u00e7ara), Brazil; respectively.

A set of eight core effectors were shared among all Moniliophthora isolates, while others were shared either between the wild solanaceous isolates or among cacao isolates. Mostly, candidate effectors of M. perniciosa were shared among the isolates, whereas in M. roreri nearly 50% were exclusive to the specie. In addition, a large number of cell wall-degrading enzymes characteristic of hemibiotrophic fungi were found. From these, we highlighted the proteins involved in cell wall modification, an enzymatic arsenal that allows the plant pathogens to inhabit environments with oxidative stress, which promotes degradation of plant compounds and facilitates infection.Conclusions:The present work reports six genomes and provides a database of the putative effectorome of Moniliophthora, a first step towards the understanding of the functional basis of fungal pathogenicity.", "title": "Genome sequence and effectorome of Moniliophthora perniciosa and Moniliophthora roreri subpopulations", "query": "Genome sequence and effectorome of Moniliophthora perniciosa and Moniliophthora roreri subpopulations"}

This error norm makes it possible to carry out a quantitative comparison between the two methods.

To discover the cause of this infertility, we studied the hybridization process from a cytological perspective.Results: We examined the meiotic process of pollen mother cells (PMCs) in three F 1 hybrids between S. officinarum and E. arundinaceus. Cytological analysis showed that the male parents, Hainan 92-77 and Hainan 92-105, had normal meiosis. However, the meiosis process in F 1 hybrids showed various abnormal phenomena, including lagging chromosomes, micronuclei, uneven segregation, chromosome bridges, and inability to form cell plates. Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) showed unequal chromatin distribution during cell division. Interestingly, 96.70% of lagging chromosomes were from E. arundinaceus. Furthermore, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed using 45S rDNA and 5S rDNA as probes. Either 45S rDNA or 5S rDNA sites were lost during abnormal meiosis, and results of unequal chromosomal separation were also clearly observed in tetrads.

A diminution of the ballast could reduce the settling speed of aggregates, resulting in a change in the carbon flux to the deep sea.

Our hypothesis was that the decrease of pH will increase the dissolution of particulate inorganic carbon ballasting the aggregates, consequently reducing their settling velocity and increasing their residence time in the upper twilight zone. Using a new methodology for simulation of aggregate settling, our results suggest that future pCO 2 conditions can significantly change the ballast composition of sinking aggregates. The change in aggregate composition had an effect on the size distribution of the aggregates, with a shift to smaller aggregates. A change also occurred in the settling velocity of the particles, which would lead to a higher residence time in the water column, where they could be continuously degraded. In the environment, such an effect would result in a reduction of the carbon flux to the deep-sea.

For a detailed understanding of the dependence of acid-base regulation on water parameters, we investigated the physiological responses of the shore crab Carcinus maenas to 4 weeks of ocean acidification [OA, P(CO 2 ) w = 1800 \u00b5atm], at variable water bicarbonate levels, paralleled by changes in water pH. Cardiovascular performance was determined together with extra-(pH e ) and intracellular pH (pH i ), oxygen consumption, haemolymph CO 2 parameters, and ion composition.

These coastal zones are transitions between freshwater and marine systems where multiple biogeochemical processes remove, produce and transform organic matter. The extent to which the coastal zone is merely a conduit for terrestrial (allochthonous) organic matter, versus a distinct source of autochthonous organic matter fueled by eutrophication, is unclear. To address this issue, we characterized the freshwater and marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) pools in an eutrophic estuary with a long water residence time (Roskilde Fjord, Denmark) over an annual cycle. We combined elemental, optical (absorbance and fluorescence) and isotopic analyses to obtain insight about the bulk properties of the DOM pool during this period. We also used sediment traps to analyze the changes related to the exchange of organic matter between the particulate (POM) and dissolved (DOM) fractions.The results showed that labile autochthonous DOM from in situ primary production was rapidly transformed to more recalcitrant DOM that accumulated in the estuary despite continuous exchange with the open sea. Also, parts of the POM pool were degraded rapidly (within 24h) and transformed into the DOM pool. Accumulated DOM was characterized by relatively low molecular size and stable carbon isotopic value, and by high protein-like fluorescence. These results indicate that autotrophic material can be a major source of specific recalcitrant DOM in eutrophic coastal waters, contributing significantly to the flux of organic carbon to the ocean.", "title": "Eutrophication Leads to Accumulation of Recalcitrant Autochthonous Organic Matter in Coastal Environment", "query": "Eutrophication Leads to Accumulation of Recalcitrant Autochthonous Organic Matter in Coastal Environment"}

Using a naturally low-pH vent site in the Mediterranean Sea (Castello Aragonese, Ischia) mirroring projected future OA conditions, we carried out a reciprocal transplant experiment to investigate the relative importance of phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation in two populations of the sessile, calcifying polychaete Simplaria sp. (Annelida, Serpulidae, Spirorbinae): one residing in low pH and the other from a nearby ambient (i.e. high) pH site. We measured a suite of fitness-related traits (i.e. survival, reproductive output, maturation, population growth) and tube growth rates in laboratory-bred F2 generation individuals from both populations reciprocally transplanted back into both ambient and low-pH in situ habitats. Both populations showed lower expression in all traits, but increased tube growth rates, when exposed to low-pH compared with high-pH conditions, regardless of their site of origin suggesting that local adaptation to low-pH conditions has not occurred. We also found comparable levels of plasticity in the two populations investigated, suggesting no influence of long-term exposure to low pH on the ability of populations to adjust their phenotype. Despite high variation in trait values among sites and the relatively extreme conditions at the low pH site (pH < 7.36), response trends were consistent across traits. Hence, our data suggest that, for Simplaria and possibly other calcifiers, neither local adaptations nor sufficient phenotypic plasticity levels appear to suffice in order to compensate for the negative impacts of OA on long-term survival.

Reporting accurate radiocarbon dates thus requires a correction for the procedural blank. We present our approach to assess the fraction modern carbon (F 14 C) and the mass of the procedural blanks introduced during the preparation procedures of lipid biomarkers (i.e. n-alkanoic acids) and lignin phenols. We isolated differently sized aliquots (6-151 \u03bcgC) of n-alkanoic acids and lignin phenols obtained from standard materials with known F 14 C values. Each compound class was extracted from two standard materials (one fossil, one modern) and purified using the same procedures as for natural samples of unknown F 14 C. There is an inverse linear relationship between the measured F 14 C values of the processed aliquots and their mass, which suggests constant contamination during processing of individual samples. We use Bayesian methods to fit linear regression lines between F 14 C and 1/mass for the fossil and modern standards.

Highresolution studies of eolian dust supply and sea surface temperature recorded in marine core MD03-2705, on the Mauritanian margin, provide a better understanding about the penultimate glacial history of northwestern African aridity/humidity and upwelling coastal activity. Today, site MD03-2705 experiences increased upwelling and dust flux during the winter months, when the ITCZ is in a southerly position. Analyses of foraminifera isotopic composition suggest that during MIS 6.5 (180-168 ka) the average position of the ITCZ migrated north, marked by an increase in the strength of the summer monsoon, which decreased eolian dust transport and the coastal upwelling activity. The northward migration is in phase with a specific orbital combination of a low precessional index with a high obliquity signal. High-resolution analysis of stable isotopes (d 18 O and d 13 C) and microscale resolution geochemical (Ti/Al and quartz grain counts) determinations reveal that the transition between monsoonal humid (MIS 6.5) and dry (MIS 6.4) conditions has occurred in less than 1.3 ka. Such rapid changes suggest a nonlinear link between the African monsoonal rainfall system and environmental changes over the continent.

In this study, we present a simple Hg mass balance model (MMBM) to predict Hg concentration in fish. This MMBM was applied with three methods of estimating food consumption rates to predict Hg concentration in three freshwater fish species. The MMBM accurately predicted the accumulation of Hg in the three fish species examined in this study when it was combined with food consumption rates that were determined with a radioisotopic method. The MMBM tended to underestimate Hg concentration in fish when it was combined with food consumption rates determined using laboratory-derived bioenergetic models, possibly because activity costs derived under laboratory conditions do not adequately represent activity costs of fish in the field. When feeding rates were estimated with a bioenergetic model implemented with site-specific estimates of activity costs, the MMBM accurately predicted the concentration of Hg in fish. Therefore, until activity costs can be accurately estimated in situ, predictions obtained with the MMBM implemented with a laboratory-derived bioenergetic model should be interpreted cautiously.", "title": "PREDICTING MERCURY CONCENTRATION IN FISH USING MASS BALANCE MODELS", "query": "PREDICTING MERCURY CONCENTRATION IN FISH USING MASS BALANCE MODELS"}

All litter was sorted into 8 categories (hard plastic, soft plastic, glass, metal, clinker, fabric, longlines and fishing nets) and weighed. The distribution of litter was analysed in relation to depth, geographic area and natural (bathymetry, currents and rivers) and anthropogenic (population density and shipping routes) processes. The most abundant litter types were plastic, glass, metal and clinker. Lost or discarded fishing gear was also commonly found. On the Catalan margin, although the data indicated an accumulation of litter with increasing depth, mean weight was not significantly different between depths or between the open slope and the canyon. We propose that litter accumulated in the canyon, with high proportions of plastics, has predominantly a coastal origin, while litter collected on the open slope, dominated by heavy litter, is mostly ship-originated, especially at sites under major shipping routes. Along the trans-Mediterranean transect, although a higher amount of litter seemed to be found on the Western Mediterranean, differences of mean weight were not significant between the 3 geographic areas and the 3 depths. Here, the shallower sites, also closer to the coast, had a higher proportion of plastics than the deeper sites, which had a higher proportion of heavy litter and were often affected by shipping routes. The weight of litter was also compared to biomass of megafauna from the same samples. On the Blanes slope, the biomass of megafauna was significantly higher than the weight of litter between 900 and 2000 m depth and no significant differences were found at 2250 and 2700 m depth. Along the trans-Mediterranean transect, no significant differences were found between biomass and litter weight at all sites except in two sites: the Central Mediterranean at 1200 m depth, where biomass was higher than litter weight, and the Eastern Mediterranean at 1200 m depth, where litter weight was higher than biomass.

We identified a type of introduced mussels, called 'dock mussels', associated with port habitats and displaying a particular genetic signal of admixture between M. edulis and the Mediterranean lineage of M. galloprovincialis.These mussels exhibit similarities in their ancestry compositions, regardless of the local native genetic backgrounds and the distance separating colonised ports. We observed fine-scale genetic shifts at the port entrance, at scales below natural dispersal distance.Such sharp clines do not fit with migration-selection tension zone models, and instead suggest habitat choice and early stage adaptation to the port environment, possibly coupled with connectivity barriers. Variations in the spread and admixture patterns of dock mussels seem to be influenced by the local native genetic backgrounds encountered. We next examined departures from the average admixture rate at different loci, and compared human-mediated admixture events, to naturally admixed populations and experimental crosses. When the same M. galloprovincialis background was involved, positive correlations in the departures of loci across locations were found; but when different backgrounds were involved, no or negative correlations were observed.While some observed positive correlations might be best explained by a shared history and saltatory colonisation, others are likely produced by parallel selective events.

We show that temperature is the primary driver of coral colony (Porites astreoides and Diploria labyrinthiformis) and reef-scale calcification rates over a 2-year monitoring period from the Bermuda coral reef. On the basis of multimodel climate simulations (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) and assuming sufficient coral nutrition, our results suggest that P. astreoides and D. labyrinthiformis coral calcification rates in Bermuda could increase throughout the 21st century as a result of gradual warming predicted under a minimum CO 2 emissions pathway [representative concentration pathway (RCP) 2.6] with positive 21st-century calcification rates potentially maintained under a reduced CO 2 emissions pathway (RCP 4.5).

Yet, evidence of such linkage for copepods, the most abundant metazoans in the oceans, remains scarce, particularly for naturally corrosive Eastern Boundary Upwelling systems (EBUs). This study assessed the relationship between pH levels and traits (body and egg size) and performance (ingestion rate (IR) and egg reproduction rate (EPR)) of the numerically dominant neritic copepod Acartia tonsa, in a year-round upwelling system of the northern (23\u00b0 S) Humboldt EBUs. The study revealed decreases in chlorophyll (Chl) ingestion rate, egg production rate and egg size with decreasing pH as well as egg production efficiency, but the opposite for copepod body size. Further, ingestion rate increased hyperbolically with Chl, and saturated at ~1 \u00b5g chl. L \u22121 . Food resources categorized as high (H, >1 \u00b5g L \u22121 ) and low (L, 7.89) and future (>400 \u00b5atm pco 2, pH < 7.89) were used to compare our observations to values globally employed to experimentally test copepod sensitivity to OA. A comparison (PERMANOVA) test with Chl/pH (2*2) design showed that partially overlapping OA levels expected for the year 2100 in other ocean regions, low-pH conditions in this system negatively impacted traits and performance associated with copepod fitness. However, interacting antagonistically with pH, food resource (Chl) maintained copepod production in spite of low pH levels.

For mytilid bivalves, little is known about the mechanisms and sites of excretion. This study investigated the localization and the mechanisms of ammonia excretion in mytilid mussels. An Rh protein was found to be abundantly expressed in the apical cell membrane of the plicate organ, which was previously described as a solely respiratory organ. The Rh protein was also expressed in the gill, although at significantly lower concentrations, but was not detectable in mussel kidney. Furthermore, NH 3 /NH 4 + was not enriched in the urine, suggesting that kidneys are not involved in active NH 3 /NH 4 + excretion. Exposure to elevated seawater pH of 8.5 transiently reduced NH 3 /NH 4 + excretion rates, but they returned to control values following 24 h acclimation. These mussels had increased abundance of V-type H + -ATPase in the apical membranes of plicate organ cells; however, NH 3 /NH 4 + excretion rates were not affected by the V-type H + -ATPase specific inhibitor concanamycin A (100 nmol l \u22121 ). In contrast, inhibition of ciliary beating with dopamine and increased seawater viscosity significantly reduced NH 3 excretion rates under control pH (8.0). These results suggest that NH 3 /NH 4 + excretion in mytilid mussels takes place by passive NH 3 diffusion across respiratory epithelia via the Rh protein, facilitated by the water current produced for filter feeding, which prevents accumulation of NH 3 in the boundary layer. This mechanism would be energy efficient for sessile organisms, as they already generate water currents for filter feeding.", "title": "Ammonia excretion in mytilid mussels is facilitated by ciliary beating", "query": "Ammonia excretion in mytilid mussels is facilitated by ciliary beating"}

The ice nucleation community has recently adopted droplet freezing assays as a commonplace experimental approach. These droplet freezing experiments are often limited by contamination that causes nonhomogeneous freezing of the \\pure\\ water used to generate the droplets in the heterogeneous freezing temperature regime that is being measured. Interference from the early freezing of water is often overlooked and not fully reported, or measurements are restricted to analyzing the more ice-active INPs that freeze well above the temperature of the background water.

In this work we review a number of recent droplet freezing techniques that show great promise in reducing these interferences, and we report our own extensive series of measurements using similar methodologies. By characterizing the performance of different substrates on which the droplets are placed and of different pure water generation techniques, we recommend best practices to reduce these interferences. We tested different substrates, water sources, droplet matrixes, and droplet sizes to provide deeper insight into what methodologies are best suited for DFTs. Approaches for analyzing droplet freezing temperature spectra and accounting and correcting for the background \\pure\\ water control spectrum are also presented.

Hence, accurate estimates and forecasts of physical and biogeochemical processes at this interface are critical for sustainable blue economy planning, growth, and disaster mitigation. Such estimates and forecasts rely on accurate and integrated in situ and satellite surface observations. High-impact uses of ocean surface observations of essential ocean/climate variables (EOVs/ECVs) include (1) assimilation into/validation of weather, ocean, and climate forecast models to improve their skill, impact, and value; (2) ocean physics studies (i.e., heat, momentum, freshwater, and biogeochemical air\u2013sea \ufb02uxes) to further our understanding and parameterization of air\u2013sea processes; and (3) calibration and validation of satellite ocean products (i.e., currents, temperature, salinity, sea level, ocean color, wind, and waves).

DMS is produced by microbial degradation of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), an abundant metabolite in marine microalgae. We analyzed DMS and DMSP concentrations in surface water in the central Arctic Ocean during two expeditions north of 79 \u2022 N in 2011 and 2015. We identified three regions, which were characterized by different DMS and DMSP concentrations, dependent on the regional water masses and the relative movement of sea ice and water to each other. In addition, correlations between DMS and DMSP and correlation of the two sulfur compounds to autotrophic biomass (as chlorophyll a) differed in the regions. In the area of the nutrient rich Atlantic water inflow and short contact of this water with sea ice, DMS is present in high concentrations and correlates to DMSP as well as chlorophyll a. At two stations, particularly high DMS concentrations were found in conjunction with underice phytoplankton biomass peaks. In contrast, in mixed Atlantic and Pacific water with strong polar influence, where long-term contact between sea ice and water causes persistent stratification, only little DMS is found. Further, the correlations to DMSP and chlorophyll a are lost and the ratio of DMS to DMSP is about one order of magnitude lower, pointing toward consumption of DMSP without the production of DMS. We conclude that the duration of sea ice influence and source of the surface water do not only lead to differences in phytoplankton productivity, resulting in different DMSP concentrations, but also influence microbial recycling of DMSP to DMS or other compounds. DMS production, as possible source for aerosols, is thus presumably lower in the strongly sea ice influenced central Arctic areas than what could be expected from DMSP concentration or biomass.", "title": "Sea Ice and Water Mass Influence Dimethylsulfide Concentrations in the Central Arctic Ocean", "query": "Sea Ice and Water Mass Influence Dimethylsulfide Concentrations in the Central Arctic Ocean"}

This ocean acidification affects biological processes in a wide range of marine taxa. Here, we assess the likely responses of 'nuisance' species to ocean acidification, meaning those organisms that have undesirable effects from a human perspective. Based on a synthesis of evidence available to date, we predict increased growth and toxicity in harmful algal bloom species, and a significant increase in invasive algae in response to increased CO 2 availability. Blooms of stinging jellyfish are also expected to increase since they are highly resilient to acidification. The effects of ocean acidification on invasive molluscs (eg, oyster drills), damaging echinoderms (eg, crown-of-thorns starfish), and a wide range of nuisance taxa will vary depending on species and location. In the USA, for example, the invasive crab Carcinus maenas is resilient to projected increases in CO 2 and its impact on marine communities is expected to increase since it feeds on organisms that respond to ocean acidification with weaker defensive traits and lower recruitment. Conversely, the Red King Crab, Paralithodes camtschaticus, is adversely affected by acidification and so is expected to die back in the Barents Sea which it has invaded. Overall, we suspect that there will be an increase in nuisance species, as many have traits that are resilient to the combined warming and acidification caused by rising CO 2 levels; region-specific assessments are needed to understand responses of nuisance species in local habitats. Finally, we highlight the need for targeted studies of the effects of global change on particularly harmful marine taxa such as the seaweed Caulerpa taxifolia, the starfish Asterias amurensis, several invasive ascidians, and the lionfish Pterois volitans.", "title": "The impact of CO2 emissions on 'nuisance' marine species", "query": "The impact of CO2 emissions on 'nuisance' marine species"}

The impacts of these variations on primary productivity, fluxes of dissolved and particulate organic matter (OM) and turnover at the seafloor are still poorly understood. Here we focus on the characteristics and dynamics of the pool of marine dissolved OM (DOM) in surface sediments of the Arctic Ocean. To investigate spatial and temporal variations of DOM in relation to particulate OM input and benthic microbial community parameters, sediment porewater and overlying bottom water were collected from the long-term observatory HAUSGARTEN in June 2013 and 2014. The study area in the Fram Strait, which is partially covered by sea ice, was sampled along a bathymetric transect (1050-5500 m water depth), from east to west (7 degrees 0.2' E to 5 degrees 17' W), and from south to north (78 degrees 37' to 79 degrees 43' N). Molecular data on solid phase extracted DOM obtained via Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometric analysis and a suite of bulk chemical parameters were related to benthic biogeochemical data. Our results demonstrate a close coupling between the production and input of OM from the surface ocean to the seafloor, and the concentration and composition of DOC/DOM in the deep sea. Surface porewaters collected in 2013 from shallower stations (<= 1500 m water depth) in the eastern Fram Strait, had a signal of a larger and more recent input of OM (higher concentrations of phytodetritus). This was associated with higher numbers of molecular formulas, abundances of unsaturated aliphatic and N-containing formulas, in concert with higher enzymatic activity, phospholipids, total organic carbon and protein content. In contrast, porewaters collected in 2014 from deeper stations and from the West, were associated with lower OM input, and showed higher abundances of aromatic and oxygen-poor compounds. Higher OM input was also reflected in higher DOC concentrations and fluxes from the sediment into the water column. Our study demonstrates that regional and temporal variations in OM input can quickly translate into changes in the quantity and quality of surface porewater DOM, the latter substantially altered by deep-sea sediment bacteria.", "title": "Molecular Composition of Dissolved Organic Matter in Sediment Porewater of the Arctic Deep-Sea Observatory HAUSGARTEN (Fram Strait)", "query": "Molecular Composition of Dissolved Organic Matter in Sediment Porewater of the Arctic Deep-Sea Observatory HAUSGARTEN (Fram Strait)"}

The decline observed since the mid-1960s is 8 times faster than the long-term decreasing trend taking place over the previous centuries, with decadal mean accumulation rates consistently being below average.Previous research has shown a strong link between Roosevelt Island accumulation rates and the location and intensity of the Amundsen Sea Low, which has a significant impact on regional sea-ice extent. The decrease in accumulation rates at Roosevelt Island may therefore be explained in terms of a recent strengthening of the ASL and the expansion of sea ice in the eastern Ross Sea.

First implementations to study the Ocean Surface Boundary Layer have recently been achieved but remain very challenging due to the weakness and shallowness of such seismic reflectors. In this article, we develop a multifrequency seismic analysis of hydrographic data sets collected in a seasonally stratified midlatitude shelf by ARGO network floats to assess the detectability issue of shallow thermoclines. This analysis, for which sensitivity to the data reduction scheme used by ARGO floats for the transmission of the profiles is discussed, allows characterizing both the depth location and the frequency dependency of the dominant reflective feature of such complex structures. This approach provides the first statistical distribution of the range of variability of the frequency-dependent seismic reflection amplitude of the midlatitude seasonal thermoclines. We introduce a new parameter to quantify the overall capability of a multichannel seismic setup, including the source strength, the fold, and the ambient noise level, to detect shallow thermoclines. Seismic source signals are approximated by Ricker wavelets, providing quantitative guidelines to help in the design of seismic experiments targeting such oceanic reflectors. For shallow midlatitude seasonal thermoclines, we show that the detectability is optimal for seismic peak frequencies between 200 and 400 Hz: this means that airgun and Sparker sources are not well suited and that significant improvements of source devices will be necessary before seismic imaging of OSBL structures can be reliably attempted.", "title": "Multifrequency seismic detectability of seasonal thermoclines assessed from ARGO data", "query": "Multifrequency seismic detectability of seasonal thermoclines assessed from ARGO data"}

As a complementary approach, we analysed 24 microbial metagenomes (>0.2 \u03bcm size range) obtained from six sites in the Mediterranean Sea that vary by depth, season and filter used to retrieve the fraction. Filter-size comparison showed a significant number of viral sequences that were retained on the larger-pore filters and were different from those found in the viral fraction from the same sample, indicating that some important viral information is missing using only assembly from viromes. Besides, we were able to describe 1,323 viral genomic fragments that were more than 10Kb in length, of which 36 represented complete viral genomes including some of them retrieved from a cross-assembly from different metagenomes.

Furthermore, analysis of viral distribution using metagenomes and viromes indicated that most of the new phages were found exclusively in the Mediterranean Sea and some of them, mostly the ones recovered from deep metagenomes, do not recruit in any database probably indicating higher variability and endemicity in Mediterranean bathypelagic waters.

We estimated the magnitude and composition of southward liquid freshwater transports in the East Greenland Current near 79\u00b0 N in the Western Fram Strait between 1998 and 2011. Previous studies have found this region to be an important pathway for liquid freshwater export from the Arctic Ocean to the Nordic Seas and the North Atlantic subpolar gyre.  Our transport estimates are based on six hydrographic surveys between June and September and concurrent data from moored current meters. We combined concentrations of liquid freshwater, meteoric water (river water and precipitation), sea ice melt and brine from sea ice formation, and Pacific Water, presented in Dodd et al. (2012), with volume transport estimates from an inverse model. The average of the monthly snapshots of southward liquid freshwater transports between 10.6\u00b0 W and 4\u00b0 E is 100 \u00b1 23 mSv (3160 \u00b1 730 km3 yr\u22121), relative to a salinity of 34.9. This liquid freshwater transport consists of about 130% water from rivers and precipitation (meteoric water), 30% freshwater from the Pacific, and \u221260% (freshwater deficit) due to a mixture of sea ice melt and brine from sea ice formation.  Pacific Water transports showed the highest variation in time, effectively vanishing in some of the surveys. Comparison of our results to the literature indicates that this was due to atmospherically driven variability in the advection of Pacific Water along different pathways through the Arctic Ocean. Variations in most liquid freshwater component transports appear to have been most strongly influenced by changes in the advection of these water masses to the Fram Strait. However, the local dynamics represented by the volume transports influenced the liquid freshwater component transports in individual years, in particular those of sea ice melt and brine from sea ice formation.  Our results show a similar ratio of the transports of meteoric water and net sea ice melt as previous studies. However, we observed a significant increase in this ratio between the surveys in 1998 and in 2009. This can be attributed to higher concentrations of sea ice melt in 2009 that may have been due to enhanced advection of freshwater from the Beaufort Gyre to the Fram Strait.  Known trends and variability in the Arctic liquid freshwater inflow from rivers are not likely to have had a significant influence on the variation of liquid freshwater component transports between our surveys. On the other hand, known freshwater inflow variability from the Pacific could have caused some of the variation we observed in the Fram Strait.  The apparent absence of a trend in southward liquid freshwater transports through the Fram Strait and recent evidence of an increase in liquid freshwater storage in the Arctic Ocean raise the question: how fast will the accumulated liquid freshwater be exported from the Arctic Ocean to the deep water formation regions in the North Atlantic and will an increased export occur through the Fram Strait.", "title": "Liquid export of Arctic freshwater components through the Fram Strait 1998\u20132011", "query": "Liquid export of Arctic freshwater components through the Fram Strait 1998\u20132011"}

One way to evaluate model performance is to simulate the transport of water isotopes. Among those available, tritium is an extremely valuable tracer, because its content in the different reservoirs involved in the water cycle (stratosphere, troposphere, and ocean) varies by order of magnitude. Previous work incorporated natural tritium into Laboratoire de M\u00e9t\u00e9orologie Dynamique Zoom (LMDZ)-iso, a version of the LMDZ general circulation model enhanced by water isotope diagnostics. Here for the first time, the anthropogenic tritium injected by each of the atmospheric nuclear bomb tests between 1945 and 1980 has been first estimated and further implemented in the model; it creates an opportunity to evaluate certain aspects of LDMZ over several decades by following the bomb tritium transient signal through the hydrological cycle. Simulations of tritium in water vapor and precipitation for the period 1950-2008, with both natural and anthropogenic components, are presented in this study. LMDZ-iso satisfactorily reproduces the general shape of the temporal evolution of tritium. However, LMDZ-iso simulates too high a bomb tritium peak followed by too strong a decrease of tritium in precipitation. The too diffusive vertical advection in AGCMs crucially affects the residence time of tritium in the stratosphere. This insight into model performance demonstrates that the implementation of tritium in an AGCM provides a new and valuable test of the modeled atmospheric transport, complementing water stable isotope modeling.", "title": "Modeling the global bomb tritium transient signal with the AGCM LMDZ\u2010iso: A method to evaluate aspects of the hydrological cycle", "query": "Modeling the global bomb tritium transient signal with the AGCM LMDZ\u2010iso: A method to evaluate aspects of the hydrological cycle"}

Local species richness of six grazers was manipulated in both open and closed pools, which were embedded in a regional species pool containing all six grazers. Grazer richness showed significant net biodiversity effects on grazing in the closed, but not in the open, system. Grazer composition, on the other hand, showed significant effects on grazing in both open and closed systems, depending on which species were initially present. The two most efficient grazers were able to compensate for less efficient grazers in species mixtures, hence ensuring the function of grazing. The efficiency of top-down control of algal biomass in open systems thus depends on which particular species are lost. Further, differences in grazing between the open and closed system changed over time due to temporal dynamics in grazer composition.

INPs were ubiquitous in the microlayer and bulk seawater with freezing temperatures in the immersion mode as high as \u221214 \u2022 C. A strong negative correlation (R = \u22120.7, p = 0.02) was observed between salinity and freezing temperatures (after correction for freezing depression by the salts). One possible explanation is that INPs were associated with melting sea ice. Heat and filtration treatments of the samples show that the INPs were likely heat-labile biological materials with sizes between 0.02 and 0.2 \u00b5m in diameter, consistent with previous measurements off the coast of North America and near Greenland in the Arctic. The concentrations of INPs in the microlayer and bulk seawater were consistent with previous measurements at several other locations off the coast of North America.

This difference could not be explained by chlorophyll a concentrations derived from satellite measurements.

The isotope ratios of the Gran Canaria samples vary for SVSr/S6Sr: 0.70302-0.70346, for 143Nd/]a4Nd: 0.51275-0.51298, and for 2\u00b06pb/2\u00b04pb: 18.76-20.01. The Miocene and the Pliocene-Recent volcanics form distinct trends on isotope correlation diagrams. The most SiO2-undersaturated volcanics from each group have the least radiogenic Sr and most radiogenic Pb, whereas evolved volcanics from each group have the most radiogenic Sr and least radiogenic Pb. In the Pliocene-Recent group, the most undersaturated basalts also have the most radiogenic Nd, and the evolved volcanics have the least radiogenic Nd. The most SiO2-saturated basalts have intermediate compositions within each age group. Although the two age groups have overlapping Sr and Nd isotope ratios, the Pliocene-Recent volcanics have less radiogenic Pb than the Miocene volcanics.At least four components are required to explain the isotope systematics of Gran Canaria by mixing. There is no evidence for crustal contamination in any of the volcanics. The most undersaturated Miocene volcanics fall within the field for the two youngest and westernmost Canary Islands in all isotope correlation diagrams and thus appear to have the most plume-like (high 23SU/2\u00b04pb) HIMU-like composition. During the Pliocene-Recent epochs, the plume was located to the west of Gran Canaria. The isotopic composition of the most undersaturated Pliocene-Recent volcanics may reflect entrainment of asthenospheric material (with a depleted mantle (DM)-like composition), as plume material was transported through the upper asthenosphere to the base of the lithosphere beneath Gran Canaria. The shift in isotopic composition with increasing SiO2-saturation in the basalts and degree of differentiation for all volcanics is interpreted to reflect assimilation of enriched mantle (EM1 and EM2) (cf. [1]) in the lithosphere beneath Gran Canaria. This enriched mantle may have been derived from the continental lithospheric mantle beneath the West African Craton by thermal erosion or delamination during rifting of Pangaea. This study suggests that the enriched mantle components (EM1 and EM2) may be stored in the shallow mantle, whereas the HIMU component may have a deeper origin.", "title": "Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic evolution of Gran Canaria: evidence for shallow enriched mantle beneath the Canary Islands", "query": "Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic evolution of Gran Canaria: evidence for shallow enriched mantle beneath the Canary Islands"}

Using data for 131 teleost fish species, we performed a large-scale phylogenetic comparative analysis of how interspecific variation in resting metabolic rates (RMRs) and maximum metabolic rates (MMRs) is related to several ecological and morphological variables. Mass-and temperature-adjusted RMR and MMR are highly correlated along a continuum spanning a 30-to 40-fold range. Phylogenetic generalized least squares models suggest that RMR and MMR are higher in pelagic species and that species with higher trophic levels exhibit elevated MMR. This variation is mirrored at various levels of structural organization: gill surface area, muscle protein content, and caudal fin aspect ratio (a proxy for activity) are positively related with aerobic capacity. Muscle protein content and caudal fin aspect ratio are also positively correlated with RMR. Hypoxia-tolerant lineages fall at the lower end of the metabolic continuum. Different ecological lifestyles are associated with contrasting levels of aerobic capacity, possibly reflecting the interplay between selection for increased locomotor performance on one hand and tolerance to low resource availability, particularly oxygen, on the other. These results support the aerobic capacity model of the evolution of endothermy, suggesting elevated body temperatures evolved as correlated responses to selection for high activity levels.", "title": "Ecological Influences and Morphological Correlates of Resting and Maximal Metabolic Rates across Teleost Fish Species", "query": "Ecological Influences and Morphological Correlates of Resting and Maximal Metabolic Rates across Teleost Fish Species"}

During summer, the net short-wave radiation is the dominant energy source, while well developed turbulent processes and the heat flux in the ground lead to a cooling of the surface. About 15% of the net radiation is consumed by the seasonal thawing of the active layer in July and August. The Bowen ratio is found to vary between 0.25 and 2, depending on water content of the uppermost soil layer. During the polar night in winter, the net longwave radiation is the dominant energy loss channel for the surface, which is mainly compensated by the sensible heat flux and, to a lesser extent, by the ground heat flux, which originates from the refreezing of the active layer. The average annual sensible heat flux of \u22126.9 Wm \u22122 is composed of strong positive fluxes in July and August, while negative fluxes dominate during the rest of the year. With 6.8 Wm \u22122 , the latent heat flux more or less compensates the sensible heat flux in the annual average. Strong evaporation occurs during the snow melt period and particularly during the snowfree period in summer and fall. When the ground is covered by snow, latent heat fluxes through sublimation of snow are recorded, but are insignificant for the average surface energy budget. The near-surface atmospheric stratification is found to be predominantly unstable to neutral, when the ground is snow-free, and stable to neutral for snow-covered ground. Due to long-lasting near-surface inversions in winter, an average temperature difference of approximately 3 K exists between the air temperature at 10 m height and the surface temperature of the snow.", "title": "The annual surface energy budget of a high-arctic permafrost site on Svalbard, Norway", "query": "The annual surface energy budget of a high-arctic permafrost site on Svalbard, Norway"}

This autotrophic CO 2 fixation cycle accounts for almost all the assimilated carbon on Earth. Due to the primary role that RubisCO plays in autotrophic carbon fixation, it is important to understand how its gene expression is regulated and the enzyme is activated. Since the majority of all microorganisms are currently not culturable, we used a metagenomic approach to identify genes and enzymes associated with RubisCO expression. The investigated metagenomic DNA fragment originates from the deep-sea hydrothermal vent field Nibelungen at 8 \u2022 18 S along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. It is 13,046 bp and resembles genes from Thiomicrospira crunogena. The fragment encodes nine open reading frames (ORFs) which include two types of RubisCO, form I (CbbL/S) and form II (CbbM), two LysR transcriptional regulators (LysR1 and LysR2), two von Willebrand factor type A (CbbO-m and CbbO-1), and two AAA+ ATPases (CbbQ-m and CbbQ-1), expected to function as RubisCO activating enzymes. In silico analyses uncovered several putative LysR binding sites and promoter structures. Functions of some of these DNA motifs were experimentally confirmed. For example, according to mobility shift assays LysR1's binding ability to the intergenic region of lysR1 and cbbL appears to be intensified when CbbL or LysR2 are present. Binding of LysR2 upstream of cbbM appears to be intensified if CbbM is present. Our study suggests that CbbQ-m and CbbO-m activate CbbL and that LysR1 and LysR2 proteins promote CbbQ-m/CbbO-m expression. CbbO-1 seems to activate CbbM and CbbM itself appears to contribute to intensifying LysR's binding ability and thus its own transcriptional regulation. CbbM furthermore appears to impair cbbL expression.

Here we bring new constraints to test a firn densification model applied to the EPICA Dome C (EDC) site for the last 50 kyr, by linking the EDC ice core to the EPICA Dronning Maud Land (EDML) ice core, both in the ice phase (using volcanic horizons) and in the gas phase (using rapid methane variations). We also use the structured 10 Be peak, occurring 41 kyr before present (BP) and due to the low geomagnetic field associated with the Laschamp event, to experimentally estimate the age during this event. Our results seem to reveal an overestimate of the age by the firn densification model during the last glacial period at EDC. Tests with different accumulation rates and temperature scenarios do not entirely resolve this discrepancy. Although the exact reasons for the age overestimate at the two EPICA sites remain unknown at this stage, we conclude that current densification model simulations have deficits under glacial climatic conditions. Whatever the cause of the age overestimate, our finding suggests that the phase relationship between CO 2 and EDC temperature previously inferred for the start of the last deglaciation (lag of CO 2 by 800\u00b1600 yr) seems to be overestimated.", "title": "New constraints on the gas age-ice age difference along the EPICA ice cores, 0-50 kyr", "query": "New constraints on the gas age-ice age difference along the EPICA ice cores, 0-50 kyr"}

To better understand if benthic bacterial communities reflect the patchy distribution of chemosynthetic fauna, all major chemosynthetic habitats at REGAB were investigated using an interdisciplinary approach combining pore water geochemistry, in situ quantification of fluxes and consumption of methane, as well as bacterial community fingerprinting. This study revealed that sediments populated by different fauna assemblages show distinct biogeochemical activities and are associated with distinct sediment bacterial communities. The methane consumption rates and methane effluxes ranged over one to two orders of magnitude across habitats, and reached highest values at the mussel habitat, which hosted a different bacterial community compared to the other habitats. Clam assemblages had a profound impact on the sediment geochemistry, but less so on the bacterial community structure.

While earlier observations relied on a limited number of point observations, the recent years have seen an increase in spatially distributed light measurements underneath sea ice using remotely operated vehicles (ROV) covering a wide range of ice conditions. These measurements allow us to reconstruct the seasonal evolution of the spatial variability in light transmission. Here we present measurements of sea ice light transmittance distributions from 6 years of Arctic under-ice ROV operations. The dataset covers the entire melt period of Central Arctic sea ice. Data is combined into a pseudo time series describing the seasonal evolution of the spatial variability of sea ice optical properties from spring to autumn freeze up. In spring, snow melt increases light transmission continuously, until a secondary mode originating from translucent melt-ponds appears in the histograms of light transmittance. This secondary mode persists long into autumn, before snow fall reduces overall light levels again. Comparison to several autonomous time series measurements from single locations confirms the detected general patterns of the seasonal evolution of light transmittance variability. This also includes characteristic spectral features caused by biological processes at the ice underside. The results allow for the evaluation of three different light transmittance parameterizations, implying that light transmission in current ice-ocean models may not be accurately represented on large scales throughout all seasons while ice thickness alone is a poor predictor of light transmittance.", "title": "Seasonal Evolution of Light Transmission Distributions Through Arctic Sea Ice", "query": "Seasonal Evolution of Light Transmission Distributions Through Arctic Sea Ice"}

Nevertheless, small and localized distribution changes in the clam community indicate that it is exposed to more transient fluxes than the other communities. Observations suggest that the main megafaunal aggregations at Regab are distributed around focused zones of high flux of methane-enriched fluids likely related to distinct smaller pockmark structures that compose the larger Regab pockmark. Although most results are consistent with the existing successional models for seep communities, some observations in the distribution of the Regab mussel population do not entirely fit into these models. This is likely due to the high heterogeneity of this site formed by the coalescence of several pockmarks.

These viruses affect domestic cattle, sheep, goats and wild ruminants and are transmitted by native hematophagous midges of the genus Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae). Culicoides dis- persal is known to be stratified, i.e. due to a combination of dispersal processes occurring actively at short distances and passively or semi-actively at long distances, allowing individuals to jump hundreds of kilometers. Methods: Here, we aim to identify the environmental factors that promote or limit gene flow of Culicoides obsoletus, an abundant and widespread vector species in Europe, using an innovative framework integrating spatial, population genetics and statistical approaches. A total of 348 individuals were sampled in 46 sites in France and were genotyped using 13 newly designed microsatellite markers. Results: We found low genetic differentiation and a weak population structure for C. obsoletus across the country. Using three complementary inter-individual genetic distances, we did not detect any significant isolation by distance, but did detect significant anisotropic isolation by distance on a north-south axis. We employed a multiple regression on distance matrices approach to investigate the correlation between genetic and environmental distances. Among all the environmental factors that were tested, only cattle density seems to have an impact on C. obsoletus gene flow. Conclusions: The high dispersal capacity of C. obsoletus over land found in the present study calls for a re-evaluation of the impact of Culicoides on virus dispersal, and highlights the urgent need to better integrate molecular, spatial and statistical information to guide vector-borne disease control.

However, the extent to which parallel phenotypic and genetic divergence patterns have emerged independently is increasingly questioned by population genomic studies. Here, we document the extent of genetic differentiation within and among two geographic replicates of the coastal and marine ecotypes of the European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) gathered from Atlantic and Mediterranean locations. Using a genome-wide data set of RAD-derived SNPs, we show that habitat type (marine vs. coastal) is the most important component of genetic differentiation among populations of anchovy. By analysing the joint allele frequency spectrum of each coastal-marine ecotype pair, we show that genomic divergence patterns between ecotypes can be explained by a postglacial secondary contact following a long period of allopatric isolation (c. 300 kyrs). We found strong support for a model including heterogeneous migration among loci, suggesting that secondary gene flow has eroded past differentiation at different rates across the genome. Markers experiencing reduced introgression exhibited strongly correlated differentiation levels among Atlantic and Mediterranean regions. These results support that partial reproductive isolation and parallel genetic differentiation among replicate pairs of anchovy ecotypes are largely due to a common divergence history prior to secondary contact. They moreover provide comprehensive insights into the origin of a surprisingly strong fine-scale genetic structuring in a high gene flow marine fish, which should improve stock management and conservation actions.", "title": "Parallel genetic divergence among coastal-marine ecotype pairs of European anchovy explained by differential introgression after secondary contact", "query": "Parallel genetic divergence among coastal-marine ecotype pairs of European anchovy explained by differential introgression after secondary contact"}

New high-resolution benthic foraminiferal Cibicidoides mundulus \u03b4 18 O and \u03b4 13 C records from equatorial Pacific International Ocean Drilling Program Site U1338 are correlated to North Atlantic Ocean Drilling Program Site 982 to obtain a global perspective.

Obliquity-paced variability dominates throughout, except during the MOH. Eleven new orbital-scale isotopic stages are identified between 7.4 and 7.1 Ma. Cryosphere and carbon cycle sensitivities, estimated from \u03b4 18 O and \u03b4 13 C variability, suggest a weak cryosphere-carbon cycle coupling. The MSC termination coincided with moderate cryosphere sensitivity and reduced global ice sheets. The LMCIS coincided with reduced carbon cycle sensitivity, suggesting a driving force independent of insolation changes. The response of the cryosphere and carbon cycle to obliquity forcing is established, defined as Earth System Response (ESR). Observations reveal that two late Miocene-early Pliocene climate states existed. The first is a prevailing dynamic state with moderate ESR and obliquity-driven Antarctic ice variations, associated with reduced global ice volumes. The second is a stable state, which occurred during the MOH, with reduced ESR and lower obliquity-driven variability, associated with expanded global ice volumes.", "title": "Evaluating climatic response to external radiative forcing during the late Miocene to early Pliocene: New perspectives from eastern equatorial Pacific (IODP U1338) and North Atlantic (ODP 982) locations", "query": "Evaluating climatic response to external radiative forcing during the late Miocene to early Pliocene: New perspectives from eastern equatorial Pacific (IODP U1338) and North Atlantic (ODP 982) locations"}

Our present understanding of the impacts of ocean acidification on marine life, however, relies heavily on results from short-term CO 2 perturbation studies. Here, we present results from the first long-term CO 2 perturbation study on the dominant reefbuilding cold-water coral Lophelia pertusa and relate them to results from a short-term study to compare the effect of exposure time on the coral's responses. Short-term (1 week) high CO 2 exposure resulted in a decline of calcification by 26-29% for a pH decrease of 0.1 units and net dissolution of calcium carbonate. In contrast, L. pertusa was capable to acclimate to acidified conditions in long-term (6 months) incubations, leading to even slightly enhanced rates of calcification. Net growth is sustained even in waters sub-saturated with respect to aragonite. Acclimation to seawater acidification did not cause a measurable increase in metabolic rates. This is the first evidence of successful acclimation in a coral species to ocean acidification, emphasizing the general need for long-term incubations in ocean acidification research.

In contrast to Earth's ecosystems, potential extraterrestrial biotopes are usually characterized by a lack of oxygen.Methods: In the MASE project (Mars Analogues for Space Exploration), we selected representative anoxic analogue environments (permafrost, salt-mine, acidic lake and river, sulfur springs) for the comprehensive analysis of their microbial communities. We assessed the microbiome profile of intact cells by propidium monoazide-based amplicon and shotgun metagenome sequencing, supplemented with an extensive cultivation effort. Results: The information retrieved from microbiome analyses on the intact microbial community thriving in the MASE sites, together with the isolation of 31 model microorganisms and successful binning of 15 high-quality genomes allowed us to observe principle pathways, which pinpoint specific microbial functions in the MASE sites compared to moderate environments. The microorganisms were characterized by an impressive machinery to withstand physical and chemical pressures. All levels of our analyses revealed the strong and omnipresent dependency of the microbial communities on complex organic matter. Moreover, we identified an extremotolerant cosmopolitan group of 34 poly-extremophiles thriving in all sites.Conclusions: Our results reveal the presence of a core microbiome and microbial taxonomic similarities between saline and acidic anoxic environments. Our work further emphasizes the importance of the environmental, terrestrial parameters for the functionality of a microbial community, but also reveals a high proportion of living microorganisms in extreme environments with a high adaptation potential within habitability borders.", "title": "Taxonomic and functional analyses of intact microbial communities thriving in extreme, astrobiology-relevant, anoxic sites", "query": "Taxonomic and functional analyses of intact microbial communities thriving in extreme, astrobiology-relevant, anoxic sites"}

This imbalance is coined Earth\u2019s Energy Imbalance (EEI). It is mostly caused by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and is driving the current warming of the planet. Precise monitoring of EEI is critical to assess the current status of climate change and the future evolution of climate. But the monitoring of EEI is challenging as EEI is two orders of magnitude smaller than the radiation \ufb02uxes in and out of the Earth system. Over 93% of the excess energy that is gained by the Earth in response to the positive EEI accumulates into the ocean in the form of heat. This accumulation of heat can be tracked with the ocean observing system such that today, the monitoring of Ocean Heat Content (OHC) and its long-term change provide the most ef\ufb01cient approach to estimate EEI. In this community paper we review the current four state-of-the-art methods to estimate global OHC changes and evaluate their relevance to derive EEI estimates on different time scales. These four methods make use of: (1) direct observations of in situ temperature; (2) satellite-based measurements of the ocean surface net heat \ufb02uxes; (3) satellite-based estimates of the thermal expansion of the ocean and (4) ocean reanalyses that assimilate observations from both satellite and in situ instruments. For each method we review the potential and the uncertainty of the method to estimate global OHC changes. We also analyze gaps in the current capability of each method and identify ways of progress for the future to ful\ufb01ll the requirements of EEI monitoring. Achieving the observation of EEI with suf\ufb01cient accuracy will depend on merging the remote sensing techniques with in situ measurements of key variables as an integral part of the Ocean Observing System.", "title": "Measuring Global Ocean Heat Content to Estimate the Earth Energy Imbalance", "query": "Measuring Global Ocean Heat Content to Estimate the Earth Energy Imbalance"}

We studied how future ocean acidification (OA) will affect biotic and abiotic processes in sediments from two coral reefs of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. This was investigated in the laboratory under conditions where water-sediment exchange was dominated by molecular diffusion (Magnetic Island) or by porewater advection (Davies Reef). OA conditions (+ pCO 2 : 170-900 \u00b5atm, \u2212 pH: 0.1-0.4) did not affect photosynthesis, aerobic and anaerobic organic matter remineralization, and growth of microphytobenthos. However, microsensor measurements showed that OA conditions reduced the porewater pH. Under diffusive conditions these changes were limited to the upper sediment layers. In contrast, advective conditions caused a deeper penetration of low pH water into the sediment resulting in an earlier pH buffering by dissolution of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ). This increased the dissolution of Davis Reef sediments turning them from net precipitating (\u22120.8 g CaCO 3 m \u22122 d \u22121 ) under ambient to net dissolving (1 g CaCO 3 m \u22122 d \u22121 ) under OA conditions. Comparisons with in-situ studies on other reef sediments show that our dissolution rates are reasonable estimates for field settings. We estimate that enhanced dissolution due to OA will only have a minor effect on net ecosystem calcification of the Davies Reef flat (<4%). However, it could decrease recent sediment accumulation rates in the lagoon by up to 31% (by 0.2-0.4 mm year \u22121 ), reducing valuable reef space. Furthermore, our results indicate that high-magnesium calcite is predominantly dissolving in the studied sediments and a drastic reduction in this mineral can be expected on Davis Reef lagoon in the near future, leaving sediments of an altered mineral composition. This study demonstrates that biotic sediment processes will likely not directly be affected by OA.

In combination, these impacts may explain the pronounced deep-water formation in the southern high latitudes from the middle Miocene to the late Miocene.", "title": "Impact of Weddell Sea shelf progradation on Antarctic bottom water formation during the Miocene", "query": "Impact of Weddell Sea shelf progradation on Antarctic bottom water formation during the Miocene"}

Surprisingly little is known about how OA affects the physiology of heterotrophic bacteria or the coupling of heterotrophic bacteria to phytoplankton when nutrients are limited. Previous experiments were, for the most part, undertaken during productive phases or following nutrient additions designed to stimulate algal blooms. Therefore, we performed an in situ large-volume mesocosm (\u223c 55 m 3 ) experiment in the Baltic Sea by simulating different fugacities of CO 2 (f CO 2 ) extending from present to future conditions. The study was conducted in July-August after the nominal spring bloom, in order to maintain low-nutrient conditions throughout the experiment. This resulted in phytoplankton communities dominated by small-sized functional groups (picophytoplankton). There was no consistent f CO 2 -induced effect on bacterial protein production (BPP), cell-specific BPP (csBPP) or biovolumes (BVs) of either free-living (FL) or particleassociated (PA) heterotrophic bacteria, when considered as individual components (univariate analyses). Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA) revealed a significant effect of the f CO 2 treatment on entire assemblages of dissolved and particulate nutrients, metabolic parameters and the bacteria-phytoplankton community. However, distance-based linear modelling only identified f CO 2 as a factor explaining the variability observed amongst the microbial community composition, but not for explaining variability within the metabolic parameters. This suggests that f CO 2 impacts on microbial metabolic parameters occurred indirectly through varying physicochemical parameters and microbial species composition. Cluster analyses examining the co-occurrence of different functional groups of bacteria and phytoplankton further revealed a separation of the four f CO 2 -treated mesocosms from both control mesocosms, indicating that complex trophic interactions might be altered in a future acidified ocean. Possible consequences for nutrient cycling and carbon export are still largely unknown, in particular in a nutrient-limited ocean.", "title": "Ocean acidification impacts bacteria\u2013phytoplankton coupling at low-nutrient conditions", "query": "Ocean acidification impacts bacteria\u2013phytoplankton coupling at low-nutrient conditions"}

To capture and understand the high spatial and temporal variability in physical and biogeochemical parameters found in these regions, novel measurement techniques have to be combined in an interdisciplinary manner. Here we use high-resolution glider-based physical-biogeochemical observations in combination with ship-based underwater vision profiler, sensor and bottle data to investigate the drivers of oxygen and nitrate variability across the shelf break off Mauritania in June 2014. Distinct oxygen and nitrate variability shows up in our glider data. High-oxygen and low-nitrate anomalies were clearly related to water mass variability and probably linked to ocean transport. Low-oxygen and high-nitrate patches co-occurred with enhanced turbidity signals close to the seabed, which suggests locally high microbial respiration rates of resuspended organic matter near the sea floor. This interpretation is supported by high particle abundance observed by the underwater vision profiler and enhanced particle-based respiration rate estimates close to the seabed. Discrete in situ measurements of dissolved organic carbon and amino acids suggest the formation of dissolved organic carbon due to particle dissolution near the seabed fueling additional microbial respiration. During June an increase in the oxygen concentration on the shelf break of about 15 \u00b5mol kg \u22121 was observed. These changes go along with meridional circulation changes but cannot be explained by typical water mass property changes. Thus our high-resolution interdisciplinary observations highlight the complex interplay of remote and local physical-biogeochemical drivers of oxygen and nitrate variability off Mauritania, which cannot be captured by classical shipboard observations alone.", "title": "Remote and local drivers of oxygen and nitrate variability in the shallow oxygen minimum zone off Mauritania in June 2014", "query": "Remote and local drivers of oxygen and nitrate variability in the shallow oxygen minimum zone off Mauritania in June 2014"}

Responses depend on the complex interactions between seawater chemistry, global/local stressors and species-specific physiologies. There is a significant gap regarding the effect that metabolic interactions between coexisting species may have on local seawater chemistry and the concurrent effect of OA. Here, we manipulated CO2 and temperature to evaluate the physiological responses of two common photoautotrophs from shallow tropical marine coastal ecosystems in Brazil: the calcifying alga Halimeda cuneata, and the seagrass Halodule wrightii. We tested whether or not seagrass presence can influence the calcification rate of a widespread and abundant species of Halimeda under OA and warming. Our results demonstrate that under elevated CO2, the high photosynthetic rates of H. wrightii contribute to raise H. cuneata calcification more than two-fold and thus we suggest that H. cuneata populations coexisting with H. wrightii may have a higher resilience to OA conditions. This conclusion supports the more general hypothesis that, in coastal and shallow reef environments, the metabolic interactions between calcifying and non-calcifying organisms are instrumental in providing refuge against OA effects and increasing the resilience of the more OA-susceptible species.

Marine calcifying macroalgae are susceptible to such changes due to their CaCO3 skeleton. Their physiological response to CO2-driven acidification is dependent on their carbon physiology. In this study, we used the pH drift experiment to determine the capability of 9 calcifying macroalgae to use one or more inorganic carbon (Ci) species. From the 9 species, we selected the rhodolith Sporolithon sp. as a model organism to investigate the long-term effects of extreme low pH on the physiology and biochemistry of calcifying macroalgae.

Recent studies have revealed effects of pCO2 induced changes in seawater chemistry on a variety of marine life forms, in particular calcifying organisms. To test whether the predicted increase in pCO2 will directly or indirectly (via changes in phytoplankton dynamics) affect abundance, activities, and community composition of heterotrophic bacteria during phytoplankton bloom development, we have aerated mesocosms with CO2 to obtain triplicates with three different partial pressures of CO2 (pCO2): 350 \u03bcatm (1\u00d7CO2), 700 \u03bcatm (2\u00d7CO2) and 1050 \u03bcatm (3\u00d7CO2). The development of a phytoplankton bloom was initiated by the addition of nitrate and phosphate. In accordance to an elevated carbon to nitrogen drawdown at increasing pCO2, bacterial production (BPP) of free-living and attached bacteria as well as cell-specific BPP (csBPP) of attached bacteria were related to the C:N ratio of suspended matter. These relationships significantly differed among treatments. However, bacterial abundance and activities were not statistically different among treatments. Solely community structure of free-living bacteria changed with pCO2 whereas that of attached bacteria seemed to be independent of pCO2 but tightly coupled to phytoplankton bloom development. Our findings imply that changes in pCO2, although reflected by changes in community structure of free-living bacteria, do not directly affect bacterial activity. Furthermore, bacterial activity and dynamics of heterotrophic bacteria, especially of attached bacteria, were tightly correlated to phytoplankton development and, hence, may also potentially depend on changes in pCO2.", "title": "Coupling of heterotrophic bacteria to phytoplankton bloom development at different pCO 2 levels: a mesocosm study", "query": "Coupling of heterotrophic bacteria to phytoplankton bloom development at different pCO 2 levels: a mesocosm study"}

Diet- ary and foraging substrate niche widths were best described byspecies identity, but no level of taxonomy explained behavioural interactions.

Most studies on this topic were carried out in pure cultures that challenge one virus with one bacterial clone at a time, which is very removed from real-life situations. Few studies have addressed trends of microdiversity in marine viral communities throughout depth gradients. We analyzed metagenomes from both the cellular and viral fractions of Mediterranean seawater samples spanning the epipelagic to the bathypelagic zones at depths of 15, 45, 60, and 2,000 m during the summer stratification of the water column. We evaluated microdiversity patterns by measuring the accumulation of synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations in viral genes. Our results demonstrated clear depth-dependent trends in the frequency of polymorphic sites and nonsynonymous mutations among genes encoding metabolic, structural, and replication proteins. These differences were linked to changes in energy availability, host and viral densities, and the proportions of actively replicating viruses. We propose the hypothesis that in the energy-rich, high-host-density, euphotic depths, selection acts to favor diversity of the host recognition machinery to increase host range, while in energy-depleted aphotic waters, selection acts on viral replication fitness, enhancing diversity in auxiliary metabolic genes. IMPORTANCE Viruses are extremely abundant and diverse biological entities that contribute to the functioning of marine ecosystems. Despite their recognized importance, few studies have addressed trends of mutation accumulation in marine viral communities across depth gradients. By investigating these trends, we show that mutation frequencies differ among viral genes according to their molecular functions, with the highest microdiversity occurring among proteins related to host metabolism, followed by structural proteins and, lastly, genome replication proteins. This is in agreement with evolutionary theory that postulates that housekeeping genes are under strong purifying selection. We also observed a positive association between depth and microdiversity. One exception to this trend was the host recognition proteins from the deep chlorophyll maximum, which displayed strikingly high microdiversity, which we hypothesize to be associated with intraspecies competition for hosts. Finally, our data allowed us to propose a theoretical model for viral microdiversity across the depth gradient. These discoveries are of special relevance because many of the viral genomic sequences discovered here were predicted to infect some of the most abundant bacteria in marine ecosystems, such as \\Candidatus Pelagibacter,\\ Puniceispirillum, and Prochlorococcus., The evolutionary interactions between viruses and their prokaryotic hosts remain a little-known aspect of microbial evolution. Most studies on this topic were carried out in pure cultures that challenge one virus with one bacterial clone at a time, which is very removed from real-life situations. Few studies have addressed trends of microdiversity in marine viral communities throughout depth gradients. We analyzed metagenomes from both the cellular and viral fractions of Mediterranean seawater samples spanning the epipelagic to the bathypelagic zones at depths of 15, 45, 60, and 2,000 m during the summer stratification of the water column. We evaluated microdiversity patterns by measuring the accumulation of synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations in viral genes. Our results demonstrated clear depth-dependent trends in the frequency of polymorphic sites and nonsynonymous mutations among genes encoding metabolic, structural, and replication proteins. These differences were linked to changes in energy availability, host and viral densities, and the proportions of actively replicating viruses. We propose the hypothesis that in the energy-rich, high-host-density, euphotic depths, selection acts to favor diversity of the host recognition machinery to increase host range, while in energy-depleted aphotic waters, selection acts on viral replication fitness, enhancing diversity in auxiliary metabolic genes. IMPORTANCE Viruses are extremely abundant and diverse biological entities that contribute to the functioning of marine ecosystems. Despite their recognized importance, few studies have addressed trends of mutation accumulation in marine viral communities across depth gradients. By investigating these trends, we show that mutation frequencies differ among viral genes according to their molecular functions, with the highest microdiversity occurring among proteins related to host metabolism, followed by structural proteins and, lastly, genome replication proteins. This is in agreement with evolutionary theory that postulates that housekeeping genes are under strong purifying selection. We also observed a positive association between depth and microdiversity. One exception to this trend was the host recognition proteins from the deep chlorophyll maximum, which displayed strikingly high microdiversity, which we hypothesize to be associated with intraspecies competition for hosts. Finally, our data allowed us to propose a theoretical model for viral microdiversity across the depth gradient. These discoveries are of special relevance because many of the viral genomic sequences discovered here were predicted to infect some of the most abundant bacteria in marine ecosystems, such as \\Candidatus Pelagibacter,\\ Puniceispirillum, and Prochlorococcus.", "title": "Trends of Microdiversity Reveal Depth-Dependent Evolutionary Strategies of Viruses in the Mediterranean", "query": "Trends of Microdiversity Reveal Depth-Dependent Evolutionary Strategies of Viruses in the Mediterranean"}

Not much information exists to ascertain if the modern current and productivity patterns subsisted under glacial climate conditions, such as during marine isotope stage (MIS) 2, and how North Atlantic meltwater events, especially Heinrich events, affected them. To help answer these questions we are combining stable isotope records of surface to subsurface dwelling planktonic foraminifer species with sea surface temperature and export productivity data for four cores distributed along the western and southwestern Iberian margin (MD95-2040, MD95- 2041, MD99-2336, and MD99-2339). The records reveals that with the exception of the Heinrich events and Greenland Stadial (GS) 4 hydrographic conditions along the western Iberian margin were not much different from the present. During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), subtropical surface and subsurface waters penetrated poleward to at least 40.6\ufffdN (site MD95-2040). Export productivity was, in general, high on the western margin during the LGM and low in the central Gulf of Cadiz, in agreement with the modern situation. During the Heinrich events and GS 4, on the other hand, productivity was high in the Gulf of Cadiz and suppressed in the upwelling regions along the western margin where a strong halocline inhibited upwelling. Heinrich event 1 had the strongest impact on the hydrography and productivity off Iberia and was the only period when subarctic surface waters were recorded in the central Gulf of Cadiz. South of Lisbon (39\ufffdN), the impact of the other Heinrich events was diminished, and not all of them led to a significant cooling in the surface waters. Thus, climatic impacts of Heinrich events highly varied with latitude and the prevailing hydrographic conditions in this region.", "title": "Hydrographic conditions along the western Iberian margin during marine isotope stage 2", "query": "Hydrographic conditions along the western Iberian margin during marine isotope stage 2"}

The records from MD99-2334K have been placed on the GISP2 timescale via the synchrony of temperature changes recorded in the Greenland ice cores and in North Atlantic planktonic d 18 O cc (calcite d 18 O). On the basis of a range of estimates for past source water D 14 C, this permits the estimation of 14 C projection ventilation ages for comparison with benthicplanktonic 14 C age differences. Although the accurate estimation of past ventilation ages is precluded by unknown deep water D 14 C source signatures, and by uncertainty regarding the extent of deep water mixing, it is clear that deep water ventilation in the northeast Atlantic was significantly reduced during the last glaciation, increased abruptly coincident with the B\u00f8lling-Aller\u00f8d warming, and rapidly became reduced again during the Younger Dryas cold reversal. The character of these changes is consistent with a varying dominance of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) versus Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW). Parallel benthic d 13 C, deep water temperature (T dw ), and deep water d 18 O (d 18 O dw ) estimates support this inference. The fact that deglacial changes in the deep water radiocarbon content of the northeast Atlantic run parallel to opposite changes in atmospheric radiocarbon content, and in parallel with Greenland temperature fluctuations, unequivocally implicates changes in ocean circulation in deglacial climate evolution and illustrates the capacity for the deep ocean to respond and contribute to abrupt climate change.", "title": "Rapid transient changes in northeast Atlantic deep water ventilation age across Termination I", "query": "Rapid transient changes in northeast Atlantic deep water ventilation age across Termination I"}

Global warming and overexploitation both threaten the integrity and resilience of marine ecosystems. Many calls have been made to at least partially offset climate change impacts through local conservation management. However, a mechanistic understanding of the interactions of multiple stressors is generally lacking for habitat-forming species; preventing the development of sound conservation strategies.2. We examined the effectiveness of no-take marine protected areas (MPAs) at enhancing structural complexity and resilience to climate change on populations of an overexploited and long-lived octocoral. We used long-term data over eight populations, subjected to varying levels of disturbances, and Integral Projection Models to understand how the overfishing and mass-mortality events shape the stochastic dynamics of the Mediterranean red coral Corallium rubrum.3. Marine protected areas largely reduced colony partial mortality (i.e. shrinkage), enhancing the structural complexity of coral populations. However, there were no significant differences in individual mortality or population growth rates between protected and exploited populations. In contrast, warming had detrimental consequences for the long-term viability of red coral populations, driving steady declines and potential local extinctions due to sharp effects in survival rates.Stochastic demographic models revealed only a weak compensatory effect ofMPAs on the impacts of warming. 4. Policy implications. Our results suggest that marine protected areas (MPAs) are an effective local conservation tool for enhancing the structural complexity of red coral populations. However, MPAs may not be enough to ensure red coral's persistence under future increases in thermal stress. Accordingly, conservation strategies aiming to ensure the persistence and functional role of red coral populations should include management actions at both local (well-enforced MPAs) and global", "title": "Marine protected areas enhance structural complexity but do not buffer the consequences of ocean warming for an overexploited precious coral", "query": "Marine protected areas enhance structural complexity but do not buffer the consequences of ocean warming for an overexploited precious coral"}

We focus on the final 15 years of the simulations (1993\u20132007), as this is a period where the CORE-II atmospheric state is well sampled, and it allows us to compare sea level related fields to both satellite and in situ analyses. The ensemble mean of the CORE-II simulations broadly agree with various global and regional observation-based analyses during this period, though with the global mean thermosteric sea level rise biased low relative to observation-based analyses. The simulations reveal a positive trend in dynamic sea level in the west Pacific and negative trend in the east, with this trend arising from wind shifts and regional changes in upper 700 m ocean heat content. The models also exhibit a thermosteric sea level rise in the subpolar North Atlantic associated with a transition around 1995/1996 of the North Atlantic Oscillation to its negative phase, and the advection of warm subtropical waters into the subpolar gyre.

The 20 p.p.m.v. increase of atmospheric CO2 and the small decrease in d13C of about 0.05% during the later Holocene can mostly be explained by contributions from carbonate compensation of earlier land-biosphere uptake and coral reef forma- tion, with only a minor contribution from a small decrease of the land-biosphere carbon inventory.", "title": "Stable isotope constraints on Holocene carbon cycle changes from an Antarctic ice core", "query": "Stable isotope constraints on Holocene carbon cycle changes from an Antarctic ice core"}

We equipped a gas diffusion chamber with a broad-range fibre-optic spectrophotometer and a micro-pH optode and recorded changes of pigment oxygenation along oxygen partial pressure (P O2 ) and pH gradients to test the setup. Oxygen binding parameters derived from measurements in only 15 \u03bcl of haemolymph from the cephalopod Octopus vulgaris showed low instrumental error (0.93%) and good agreement with published data. Broad-range spectra, each resolving 2048 data points, provided detailed insight into the complex absorbance characteristics of diverse blood types. After consideration of photobleaching and intrinsic fluorescence, pH optodes yielded accurate recordings and resolved a sigmoidal shift of 0.03 pH units in response to changing P O2 from 0 to 21 kPa. Highly resolved continuous recordings along pH gradients conformed to stepwise measurements at low rates of pH changes. In this study we showed that a diffusion chamber upgraded with a broad-range spectrophotometer and an optical pH sensor accurately characterizes oxygen binding with minimal sample consumption and manipulation.

The concept of oxygen-and capacity-limited thermal tolerance, which is inspired by the Fry paradigm of a bell-shaped increase-optimum-decrease-type response of aerobic scope to increasing temperature, but also includes proposed negative and synergistic effects of elevated CO 2 levels, has been suggested as a unifying framework. The objectives of this meta-analysis were to assess the following: (i) the generality of a bell-shaped relationship between absolute aerobic scope (AAS) and temperature; (ii) to what extent elevated CO 2 affects resting oxygen uptake MO2rest and AAS; and (iii) whether there is an interaction between elevated temperature and CO 2 . The behavioural effects of CO 2 are also briefly discussed. In 31 out of 73 data sets (both acutely exposed and acclimated), AAS increased and remained above 90% of the maximum, whereas a clear thermal optimum was observed in the remaining 42 data sets. Carbon dioxide caused a significant rise in MO2rest in only 18 out of 125 data sets, and a decrease in 25, whereas it caused a decrease in AAS in four out of 18 data sets and an increase in two. The analysis did not reveal clear evidence for an overall correlation with temperature, CO 2 regime or duration of CO 2 treatment. When CO 2 had an effect, additive rather than synergistic interactions with temperature were most common and, interestingly, they even interacted antagonistically on MO2rest and AAS. The behavioural effects of CO 2 could complicate experimental determination of respiratory performance.

Those ocean responses are first characterized from the statistical analysis of satellite data under ~1000 TCs over the 1998-2007 period. Besides the cold wake, the vast majority of TCs induce a weak chlorophyll response, with only ~10% of induced blooms exceeding 0.1 mg m \u00c03 . The largest chlorophyll responses mostly occur within coastal regions, in contrast to the strongest cold wakes that generally occur farther offshore. To understand this decoupling, we analyze a coupled dynamical-biogeochemical oceanic simulation forced by realistic wind vortices applied along observed TC tracks. The simulation displays a realistic spatial structure of TC-induced blooms and its observed decoupling with TC cold wakes. In regions of strong TC energy input, the strongest cold wakes occur in regions of shallow thermocline (<60 m) and the strongest blooms in regions of shallow nitracline and/or subsurface chlorophyll maximum (<60 m). Shallow thermoclines are found over many open ocean regions, while regions of shallow nitracline and/or subsurface chlorophyll maximum are most prominent in near-coastal areas, explaining the spatial decoupling between the cold and bloom wakes. The overall TC contribution to annual primary production is weak and amounts to ~1%, except in a few limited areas (east Eurasian coast, South tropical Indian Ocean, Northern Australian coast, and Eastern Pacific Ocean in the TC-prone region) where it can locally reach up to 20-30%. Nearly 80% of this TC-induced annual primary production is the result of the biogeochemical response to the 30% strongest TCs.Remotely sensed surface chlorophyll observations nevertheless allowed several investigations of the regional surface chlorophyll responses to TCs.

From novel mooring observations in the Irminger Sea (2014\u20132016), we describe two water masses that are formed by convection and show that they have different rates of export in the western boundary current. Upper Irminger Sea Intermediate Water appears to form near the boundary current and is exported rapidly within 3 months of its formation. Deep Irminger Sea Intermediate Water forms in the basin interior and is exported on longer time scales. The subduction of these waters into the boundary current is consistent with an eddy transport mechanism. Our results suggest that light intermediate waters can contribute to overturning as much as waters formed by deeper convection and that the export time scales of both project onto overturning variability. Plain Language Summary The deep ocean can regulate the Earth's climate by storing carbon and heat. At high latitudes, waters are cooled by the atmosphere and sink, but they can only be successfully stored in the deep ocean if they are exported toward the equator. In this study, we analyze new mooring observations in the Irminger Sea to investigate the cooling and export of high-latitude waters. In addition to the well-documented waters that are cooled in the center of the Irminger Sea, we find that saltier waters are cooled near the western boundary current. Both of these water types make it into boundary current and are exported. Our observations are consistent with the dynamics of swirling eddy motions. The eddy transport process is more effective for the waters cooled near the boundary current, implying that cooling near boundary currents may be more important for the climate than has been appreciated to date.", "title": "Rapid Export of Waters Formed by Convection Near the Irminger Sea's Western Boundary", "query": "Rapid Export of Waters Formed by Convection Near the Irminger Sea's Western Boundary"}

How such alterations impact transcriptional responses to pathogen infection is a 'different kettle of fish' and remains poorly understood. Here, we assessed survival and gene expression profiles of infected fish reared at two different densities to elucidate potential functional genomic mechanisms for density-related differences in disease susceptibility. Results: Utilising a whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq) approach, we demonstrate that rearing density in tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) significantly impacts susceptibility to the oomycete Saprolegnia parasitica, via altered transcriptional infection responses. Tilapia held at low densities have increased expression of genes related to stress, likely due to increased aggressive interactions. When challenged with Saprolegnia, low-density fish exhibit altered expression of inflammatory gene responses and enhanced levels of adaptive immune gene suppression compared to fish reared at higher density, resulting in significantly increased mortality rates. In addition, Saprolegnia infection substantially perturbs expression of circadian clock genes, with fish reared at low-density having higher levels of molecular clock dysregulation.

There, methane is mainly produced microbially in anoxic sediments from which it can escape to the overlying water column. Aerobic methane oxidation (MOx) in the water column acts as a biological filter, reducing the amount of methane that eventually evades to the atmosphere. The efficiency of the MOx filter is potentially controlled by the availability of dissolved methane and oxygen, as well as temperature, salinity, and hydrographic dynamics, and all of these factors undergo strong temporal fluctuations in coastal ecosystems. In order to elucidate the key environmental controls, specifically the effect of oxygen availability, on MOx in a seasonally stratified and hypoxic coastal marine setting, we conducted a 2-year time-series study with measurements of MOx and physicochemical water column parameters in a coastal inlet in the south-western Baltic Sea (Eckernf\u00f6rde Bay). We found that MOx rates generally increased toward the seafloor, but were not directly linked to methane concentrations. MOx exhibited a strong seasonal variability, with maximum rates (up to 11.6 nmol L \u22121 d \u22121 ) during summer stratification when oxygen concentrations were lowest and bottom-water temperatures were highest. Under these conditions, 2.4-19.0 times more methane was oxidized than emitted to the atmosphere, whereas about the same amount was consumed and emitted during the mixed and oxygenated periods. Laboratory experiments with manipulated oxygen concentrations in the range of 0.2-220 \u00b5mol L \u22121 revealed a submicromolar oxygen optimum for MOx at the study site. In contrast, the fraction of methane-carbon incorporation into the bacterial biomass (compared to the total amount of oxidized methane) was up to 38-fold higher at saturated oxygen concentrations, suggesting a different partitioning of catabolic and anabolic processes under oxygen-replete and oxygen-starved conditions, respectively. Our results underscore the importance of MOx in mitigating methane emission from coastal waters and indicate an organism-level adaptation of the water column methanotrophs to hypoxic conditions.", "title": "Effects of low oxygen concentrations on aerobic methane oxidation in seasonally hypoxic coastal waters", "query": "Effects of low oxygen concentrations on aerobic methane oxidation in seasonally hypoxic coastal waters"}

Surface water, which was characterized by low concentrations of dissolved inorganic nutrients and chlorophyll a (a proxy of phytoplankton biomass), was enclosed in nine mesocosms and subjected to eight pCO 2 levels (two replicated controls and seven enhanced pCO 2 treatments) for one month. Nutrients were added to all mesocosms on day 13 of the experiment, and thereafter increase of chlorophyll a was provoked in all mesocosms. No clear trend in response to increasing pCO 2 was found in the daily values of NCP, CR, and GCP. For further analysis, these parameters were cumulated for the following three periods: phase 1 -end of CO 2 manipulation until nutrient addition (t4 to t13); phase 2 -nutrient addition until the second chlorophyll a minimum (t14 to t21); phase 3 -the second chlorophyll a minimum until the end of this study (t22 to t28). A significant response was detected as a decrease of NCP with increasing pCO 2 during phase 3. CR was relatively stable throughout the experiment in all mesocosms. As a result, the cumulative GCP significantly decreased with increasing pCO 2 during phase 3. After the nutrient addition, the ratios of cumulative NCP to cumulative consumption of NO 3 and PO 4 showed a significant decrease during phase 3 with increasing pCO 2 . The results suggest that elevated pCO 2 influenced cumulative NCP and stoichiometric C and nutrient coupling of the plankton community in a high-latitude fjord only for a limited period.

The acidic pH in stomachs of vertebrates is believed to aid digestion and to protect against environmental pathogens. Little attention has been placed on whether acidic gastric pH regulation is a vertebrate character or a deuterostome ancestral trait. Here, we report alkaline conditions up to pH 10.5 in the larval digestive systems of ambulacraria (echinoderm + hemichordate), the closest relative of the chordate. Microelectrode measurements in combination with specific inhibitors for acid-base transporters and ion pumps demonstrated that the gastric alkalization machinery in sea urchin larvae is mainly based on direct H + secretion from the stomach lumen and involves a conserved set of ion pumps and transporters. Hemichordate larvae additionally utilized HCO 3 \u2212 transport pathways to generate even more alkaline digestive conditions. Molecular analyses in combination with acidification experiments supported these findings and identified genes coding for ion pumps energizing gastric alkalization. Given that insect larval guts were also reported to be alkaline, our discovery raises the hypothesis that the bilaterian ancestor utilized alkaline digestive system while the vertebrate lineage has evolved a strategy to strongly acidify their stomachs.The highly acidic pH of most vertebrate stomachs is believed to protect against environmental pathogens and the mechanisms of gastric acidification are well described [1][2][3] . The H + /K + -ATPase (HKA) in luminal membranes of parietal cells drives H + ions into the stomach lumen leading to an accumulation of hydrochloric acid 4 . This enables vertebrates to generate highly acidic conditions in their digestive systems. In contrast, midgut alkalization in lepidopteran and dipteran insect larvae, is energized by an V-H + -ATPase (VHA) coupled to processes that result in net export of H + from the luminal space 5-7 . These observations demonstrate that different gastric pH regulatory mechanisms have evolved in the animal kingdom. An interest is thus raised in regard to whether the highly acidic or alkaline digestive system is an ancestral character of the bilaterian.Although marine invertebrates were described to have slightly acidic to neutral pH in their digestive systems 8,9 virtually nothing is known regarding gastric pH regulation of their larval stages. In a previous study we demonstrated that larvae of the green sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis, have alkaline conditions in their digestive systems 10 .

The imposed perturbations act to increase the amount of heat available to melt ice, leading to a rapid Arctic sea ice retreat within 5 years after the perturbations are activated. In response, the AMOC gradually weakens over the next ~100 years. The AMOC changes can be explained by the accumulation in the Arctic and subsequent downstream propagation to the North Atlantic of buoyancy anomalies controlled by temperature and salinity. Initially, during the first decade or so, the Arctic sea ice loss results in anomalous positive heat and salinity fluxes in the subpolar North Atlantic, inducing positive temperature and salinity anomalies over the regions of oceanic deep convection. At first, these anomalies largely compensate one another, leading to a minimal change in upper ocean density and deep convection in the North Atlantic. Over the following years, however, more anomalous warm water accumulates in the Arctic and spreads to the North Atlantic. At the same time, freshwater that accumulates from seasonal sea ice melting over most of the upper Arctic Ocean also spreads southward, reaching as far as south of Iceland. These warm and fresh anomalies reduce upper ocean density and suppress oceanic deep convection. The thermal and haline contributions to these buoyancy anomalies, and therefore to the AMOC slowdown during this period, are found to have similar magnitudes. We also find that the related changes in horizontal wind-driven circulation could potentially push freshwater away from the deep convection areas and hence strengthen the AMOC, but this effect is overwhelmed by mean advection.", "title": "The Mechanisms of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation Slowdown Induced by Arctic Sea Ice Decline", "query": "The Mechanisms of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation Slowdown Induced by Arctic Sea Ice Decline"}

Equations of motion linearized around the slower turbulent field are projected onto vertical modes and assumed to describe the dynamics of the low-mode internal tide propagation. Diagnostics of the terms responsible for the interaction between the wave and the slow circulation are computed from the numerical outputs. The large-scale change of stratification, on top of eddies and jet meanders, contributes significantly to these interaction terms, which is shown to be consistent with an independent scaling analysis. The sensitivity of interaction terms to a degradation of the slow field spatial and temporal resolution indicates that present-day observing systems (Argo network, altimetry) may lack the spatial resolution necessary to correctly predict internal tide evolution. The upcoming SWOT satellite mission may improve upon this situation. The number of vertical modes required to properly estimate interaction terms is discussed.

Some fishing practices, such as bottom trawling, have caused a widespread decline in exploited fish stocks. Bottom trawling is also expected to have negative impacts on benthic habitats, usually structured by and hosting a large array of invertebrate species, which provide important ecological services to fish and commercial invertebrate stocks. However, in contrast to commercial species for which long-term time series of the abundance exist, data on these habitat-forming invertebrates are scarce, as they are usually caught as bycatch and discarded. Therefore, there is great uncertainty about their long-term trends, and if these populations are stable or declining. Here we used interview surveys conducted with bottom-trawling fishers of the central Adriatic Sea to gather local ecological knowledge on megabenthos abundance occurring in their fishing domain, as an alternative source of information to conventional fisheries data. We interviewed 44 fishers, from the most important ports of the Marche region of Italy, to understand how megabenthic species have changed in abundance within the area since the 1980s. Specifically, we asked fishers to provide qualitative abundance scores for 18 invertebrate species in five phyla (Porifera, Cnidaria, Bryozoa, Mollusca, and Echinodermata) based on their recollection of these species\u2019 presence in bycatch. We stratified responses in homogeneous temporal periods and geographic sectors of the study area, and analyzed their response with mixed effect ordered logistic regression models in order to evaluate spatiotemporal changes in the perceived abundance of each species. Our analysis suggests that the abundance of the sponge Geodia cydonium, the molluscs Pecten jacobaeus, Atrina fragilis, Neopycnodonte cochlear, and the group of holothurians, have declined. From fishers\u2019 perceptions, only the bryozoan Amathia semiconvoluta has increased. Local ecological knowledge can provide important information on environmental change and can highlight species and ecosystems at risk when conventional scientific data are scarce or absent. This approach can be expanded to other regions of the Adriatic and broader Mediterranean Sea to reconstruct change of this heavily exploited marine region.

Mineral ballast may regulate the transfer of organic matter and other components by determining the sinking rates, e.g. via particle density. We calculated particle sinking rates from mass flux patterns and alkenone measurements applying the results of sediment trap experiments from the Atlantic Ocean. We have indication for higher particle sinking rates in carbonate-dominated production systems when considering both regional and seasonal data. During a summer coccolithophorid bloom in the Cape Blanc coastal upwelling off Mauritania, particle sinking rates reached almost 570 m per day, most probably due the fast sedimentation of densely packed zooplankton fecal pellets, which transport high amounts of organic carbon associated with coccoliths to the deep ocean despite rather low production. During the recurring winter-spring blooms off NW Africa and in opalrich production systems of the Southern Ocean, sinking rates of larger particles, most probably diatom aggregates, showed a tendency to lower values. However, there is no straightforward relationship between carbonate content and particle sinking rates. This could be due to the unknown composition of carbonate and/or the influence of particle size and shape on sinking rates. It also remains noticeable that the highest sinking rates occurred in dust-rich ocean regions off NW Africa, but this issue deserves further detailed field and laboratory investigations. We obtained increasing sinking rates with depth. By using a seven-compartment biogeochemical model, it was shown that the deep ocean organic carbon flux at a mesotrophic sediment trap site off Cape Blanc can be captured fairly well using seasonal variable particle sinking rates.

Although the exact knowledge of the permeability behavior as a function of gas hydrate saturation is of crucial importance, state-of-the-art simulation codes for gas production scenarios use theoretically derived permeability equations that are hardly backed by experimental data. The reason for the insufficient validation of the model equations is the difficulty to create gas hydrate bearing sediments that have undergone formation mechanisms equivalent to the natural process and that have well-defined gas hydrate saturations. We formed methane hydrates in quartz sand from a methane-saturated aqueous solution and used magnetic resonance imaging to obtain time-resolved, three-dimensional maps of the gas hydrate saturation distribution. These maps were fed into 3-D finite element method simulations of the water flow. In our simulations, we tested the five most well-known permeability equations. All of the suitable permeability equations include the term (1-S H ) n , where S H is the gas hydrate saturation and n is a parameter that needs to be constrained. The most basic equation describing the permeability behavior of water flow through gas hydrate bearing sand is k = k 0 (1-S H ) n . In our experiments, n was determined to be 11.4 (\u00b10.3). Results from this study can be directly applied to bulk flow analysis under the assumption of homogeneous gas hydrate saturation and can be further used to derive effective permeability models for heterogeneous gas hydrate distributions at different scales.", "title": "The Dependence of Water Permeability in Quartz Sand on Gas Hydrate Saturation in the Pore Space", "query": "The Dependence of Water Permeability in Quartz Sand on Gas Hydrate Saturation in the Pore Space"}

Yet, the underlying ecological mechanisms structuring it are unclear. Here, we investigate how fundamental ecological mechanisms (selection, dispersal and ecological drift) shape the smallest members of the tropical and subtropical surface-ocean microbiota: prokaryotes and minute eukaryotes (picoeukaryotes). Furthermore, we investigate the agents exerting abiotic selection on this assemblage as well as the spatial patterns emerging from the action of ecological mechanisms. To explore this, we analysed the composition of surface-ocean prokaryotic and picoeukaryotic communities using DNA-sequence data (16S-and 18S-rRNA genes) collected during the circumglobal expeditions Malaspina-2010 and TARA-Oceans. Results: We found that the two main components of the tropical and subtropical surface-ocean microbiota, prokaryotes and picoeukaryotes, appear to be structured by different ecological mechanisms. Picoeukaryotic communities were predominantly structured by dispersal-limitation, while prokaryotic counterparts appeared to be shaped by the combined action of dispersal-limitation, selection and drift. Temperature-driven selection appeared as a major factor, out of a few selected factors, influencing species co-occurrence networks in prokaryotes but not in picoeukaryotes, indicating that association patterns may contribute to understand ocean microbiota structure and response to selection. Other measured abiotic variables seemed to have limited selective effects on community structure in the tropical and subtropical ocean. Picoeukaryotes displayed a higher spatial differentiation between communities and a higher distance decay when compared to prokaryotes, consistent with a scenario of higher dispersal limitation in the former after considering environmental heterogeneity. Lastly, random dynamics or drift seemed to have a more important role in structuring prokaryotic communities than picoeukaryotic counterparts.", "title": "Disentangling the mechanisms shaping the surface ocean microbiota", "query": "Disentangling the mechanisms shaping the surface ocean microbiota"}

The collapse of the Larsen B Ice Shelf in 2002 has been attributed to the sudden drainage of \u223c 3000 surface lakes and has highlighted the potential for surface water to cause ice-shelf instability. Surface meltwater systems have been identified across numerous Antarctic ice shelves, although the extent to which these systems impact ice-shelf instability is poorly constrained. To better understand the role of surface meltwater systems on ice shelves, it is important to track their seasonal development, monitoring the fluctuations in surface water volume and the transfer of water across ice-shelf surfaces. Here, we use Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 imagery to track surface meltwater across the Nivlisen Ice Shelf in the 2016-2017 melt season. We develop the Fully Automated Supraglacial-Water Tracking algorithm for Ice Shelves (FASTISh) and use it to identify and track the development of 1598 water bodies, which we classify as either circular or linear. The total volume of surface meltwater peaks on 26 January 2017 at 5.5 \u00d7 10 7 m 3 . At this time, 63 % of the total volume is held within two linear surface meltwater systems, which are up to 27 km long, are orientated along the ice shelf's north-south axis, and follow the surface slope. Over the course of the melt season, they appear to migrate away from the grounding line, while growing in size and enveloping smaller water bodies. This suggests there is large-scale lateral water transfer through the surface meltwater system and the firn pack towards the ice-shelf front during the summer.", "title": "Lateral meltwater transfer across an Antarctic ice shelf", "query": "Lateral meltwater transfer across an Antarctic ice shelf"}

However, the effects of elevated CO2 on learning in advanced invertebrates such as cephalopods are unknown. Any impacts to the learning abilities of cephalopods could have far-reaching consequences for their populations and the communities they inhabit. Cephalopods have some of the most advanced cognitive abilities among invertebrates and are one of the few invertebrate taxa in which conditional discrimination has been demonstrated, though the trait has not been demonstrated in any species of squid. Here, we tested for the \ufb01rst time the capacity for conditional discrimination in a squid species (Sepioteuthis lessoniana). Furthermore, we investigated the effects of projected future CO2 levels (1,084 \u00b5atm) on conditional discrimination and learning more generally. A three-task experiment within a two-choice arena was used to test learning and conditional discrimination. Learning was measured by improvements in task completion in repeated trials over time and the number of trials required to pass each task. Squid exhibited signi\ufb01cant learning capabilities, with an increase in correct choices over successive trials and a decrease in the number of trials needed to complete the successive tasks. Six of the 12 squid tested successfully passed all three tasks indicating a capacity for conditional discrimination in the species. Elevated CO2 had no effect on learning or on the capacity for conditional discrimination in squid. This study highlights the remarkable cognitive abilities of S. lessoniana, demonstrated by their capacity for conditional discrimination, and suggests that ocean acidi\ufb01cation will not compromise learning abilities. However, other behavioural traits in the species have been shown to be altered at comparable elevated CO2 conditions. It is not clear why some ecologically important behaviours are altered by elevated CO2 whereas others are unaffected.

These streams are small tributaries that flow directly into large rivers (mainstem), at least three orders greater in magnitude. The aim of this study was to analyze the structure of the ichthyofauna of five adventitious streams of the Upper Taquari River, South Pantanal, evaluating its temporal variation (dry and wet season) and the relation to the habitat characteristics and the conservation of the streams. Thirty-seven species were collected, from which 14 are exclusive to the Paraguay River basin, one species [Apteronotus albifrons (Linnaeus, 1766)] could represent a new record for this basin, and six species need taxonomic confirmation. The analysis indicated only the existence of spatial variation in the ichthyofauna structure of the streams sampled, with the similarity patterns related to the distance between the streams and to their conditions of conservation. The stream with greater size and preserved riparian forest was the one with the highest values of fish diversity and evenness. On the other hand, the stream with the smallest percentage of riparian forest and highest proximity to urban area presented the lowest diversity. The small size of these adventitious systems should serve as protection against large predators, which have their access to those areas hampered by their own size. Otherwise, the mainstem may also act as source of dispersal of small-bodied schooling fishes to the adventitious streams, where the greater heterogeneity of habitats and the presence of riparian vegetation should offer shelter and food supply for small species.

Modeled on human connectivity mapping (Cmap) in biomedical research, this study was undertaken to investigate the utility of an analogous Cmap approach in ecotoxicology. Over 3500 zebrafish (Danio rerio) and fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) transcriptomic profiles, each associated with one of several dozen chemical treatment conditions, were compiled into three distinct collections of rank-ordered gene lists (ROGLs) by species and microarray platforms. Individual query signatures, each consisting of multiple gene probes differentially expressed in a chemical condition, were used to interrogate the reference ROGLs. Results: Informative connections were established at high success rates within species when, as defined by their mechanisms of action (MOAs), both query signatures and ROGLs were associated with the same or similar chemicals. Thus, a simple query signature functioned effectively as an exposure biomarker without need for a time-consuming process of development and validation. More importantly, a large reference database of ROGLs also enabled a query signature to cross-interrogate other chemical conditions with overlapping MOAs, leading to novel groupings and subgroupings of seemingly unrelated chemicals at a finer resolution. This approach confirmed the identities of several estrogenic chemicals, as well as a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and a neuro-toxin, in the largely uncharacterized water samples near several waste water treatment plants, and thus demonstrates its future potential utility in real world applications. Conclusions: The power of Cmap should grow as chemical coverages of ROGLs increase, making it a framework easily scalable in the future. The feasibility of toxicity extrapolation across fish species using Cmap needs more study, however, as more gene expression profiles linked to chemical conditions common to multiple fish species are needed.", "title": "Fish connectivity mapping: linking chemical stressors by their mechanisms of action-driven transcriptomic profiles", "query": "Fish connectivity mapping: linking chemical stressors by their mechanisms of action-driven transcriptomic profiles"}

These icebergs and associated meltwater flux are hypothesized to have led to a shutdown of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and severe cooling in large parts of the Northern Hemisphere. However, due to the limited availability of high-resolution records, the magnitude of sea surface temperature (SST) changes related to the impact of Heinrich events on the midlatitude North Atlantic is poorly constrained. Here we present a record of U K 37 0-based SSTs derived from sediments of Integrated Ocean Drilling Project Site U1313, located at the southern end of the ice-rafted debris (IRD) belt in the midlatitude North Atlantic (41 N). We demonstrate that all six Heinrich events are associated with a rapid warming of surface waters by 2-4 C in a few thousand years. The presence of IRD leaves no doubt about the simultaneous timing and correlation between rapid surface water warming and Heinrich events. We argue that this warming in the midlatitude North Atlantic is related to a northward expansion of the subtropical gyre during Heinrich events. As a wide range of studies demonstrated that in the central IRD belt Heinrich events are associated with low SSTs, these results thus identify an antiphased (seesaw) pattern in SSTs during Heinrich events between the midlatitude (warm) and northern North Atlantic (cold). This highlights the complex response of surface water characteristics in the North Atlantic to Heinrich events that is poorly reproduced by freshwater hosing experiments and challenges the widely accepted view that, within the IRD belt of the North Atlantic, Heinrich events coincide with periods of low SSTs.", "title": "Warming of surface waters in the mid-latitude North Atlantic during Heinrich events", "query": "Warming of surface waters in the mid-latitude North Atlantic during Heinrich events"}

In the Gulf of Lion (SE France), increased inputs of organic matter from sediment-laden rivers occurred during warm substages of the last 200 kyr (MIS 5e, 5c, and 5a; MIS 6d, and 6b). Increased terrestrial organic matter are inferred from organic carbon isotopic composition (\u03b413Corg), and are interpreted as resulting from enhanced rainfall over the Rhone river catchment area. Such increase in terrestrial organic carbon induced enhancement of the primary productivity leading to the formation of local oxygen minimum zone as demonstrated by \u223c3\u2030 values in \u03b415N.

Taking advantage of the location of PRGL1-4 borehole, out of Mediterranean cyclogenesis area, we suggest that the pluvial events recorded during warm substages of the last 200 kyr occurred in response to enhanced passage of North Atlantic atmospheric perturbation over the Gulf of Lion catchment area (especially over Rhone river watershed which represent 80% of the GoL catchment area), a scenario possibly similar to that encountered today during negative- NAO like conditions. At a regional scale, our data suggests that high rainfall events over the Gulf of Lion catchement area and the Rhone watershed occurred at the time of North African summer monsoon and the sapropel deposition in the Mediterranean basin, thus highlighting a close coupling between mid- (North Atlantic) and low-latitudes (monsoon) climate systems.

Hybrids constitute a significant proportion of some countries' production for certain taxa; for example, hybrid striped bass in the USA, hybrid clarid catfish in Thailand, hybrid characids in Venezuela, and hybrid tilapia in Israel. Despite its widespread use, there is a general impression that inter-specific hybridization is not a very useful tool for aquaculture. We believe this impression stems from inaccurate reporting of some useful hybrids, limited testing of strains used for hybrids, and from early work on salmonids that did not result in hybrids of commercial advantage. Experimentation with new hybrid fishes is ongoing, especially in marine culture systems where sterile fish may be preferred because of the concern that fish may escape into the marine and coastal environment. Hybridization has been used in tandem with polyploidization to improve developmental stability in hybrid progeny. The results of inter-specific hybridization can be variable and depend on the genetic structure (including the sex) of the parent fish. Inadvertent hybridization and backcrossing can lead to unexpected and undesirable results in hybrid progeny, such as failure to produce sterile fish, loss of color pattern, and reduced 326 viability. Hybridization is only one tool to improve aquaculture production and will require knowledge of the genetic structure of the broodstock, good broodstock management and monitoring of the viability and fertility of the progeny. Hybridization does represent a genetic modification wherein genes are moved between different species; implications for biodiversity conservation and regulation of this type of modification are discussed.", "title": "The use of inter-specific hybrids in aquaculture and fisheries", "query": "The use of inter-specific hybrids in aquaculture and fisheries"}

A recent study revealed a frequency of ~2% spontaneous (i.e., non-intentional) triploidy in domesticated Atlantic salmon produced in Norwegian aquaculture in the period 2007-2014. In contrast, the frequency of triploidy in wild salmon populations has not been studied thus far, and in wild populations of other organisms, it has been very rarely studied. In population genetic data sets, individuals that potentially display chromosome abnormalities, such as triploids with three alleles, are typically excluded on the premise that they may reflect polluted or otherwise compromised samples. Here, we critically re-investigated the microsatellite genetic profile of ~6000 wild Atlantic salmon sampled from 80 rivers in Norway and Russia, to investigate the frequency of triploid individuals in wild salmon populations for the first time.Results: We detected a single triploid salmon, and five individuals displaying three alleles at one of the loci, thus regarded as putatively trisomic. This gave an overall frequency of triploid and putatively trisomic individuals in the data set of 0.017 and 0.083% respectively. The triploid salmon was an adult female, and had spent 2 years in freshwater and 2 years in the sea. Conclusions: We conclude that the frequency of naturally-occurring triploid Atlantic salmon in wild Norwegian and Russian populations is very low, and many-fold lower than the frequency of spontaneous triploids observed in aquaculture. Our results suggest that aquaculture rearing conditions substantially increase the probability of triploidy to develop, and/or permits greater survival of triploid individuals, in comparison to the wild.", "title": "Investigating the frequency of triploid Atlantic salmon in wild Norwegian and Russian populations", "query": "Investigating the frequency of triploid Atlantic salmon in wild Norwegian and Russian populations"}

We found that the localized depletion of top predators at sites accessible to recreational anglers has triggered the proliferation of herbivorous crabs, which in turn results in runaway consumption of marsh vegetation. This suggests that overfishing may be a general mechanism underlying the consumer-driven die-off of salt marshes spreading throughout the western Atlantic.

These biohybrid systems make cooperative relationships between artificial systems and animals possible, which can yield new capabilities in the resulting mixed group.

Due to human\u2010induced climate change, the AMOC is predicted to weaken substantially, with adverse impacts for regions dependent on the supply of warmth from the AMOC, including northwest Europe. Surprisingly, given its importance, the AMOC has only been directly measured for the last decade or so. We now have observation systems in place that can verify a future decline in the AMOC, if it happens. In this paper we review these observation systems in terms of the technology and methodology used. We look at how these systems might develop in the future, including covering any gaps that might exist.

Additionally, oxidative stress and energy metabolism-related biomarkers were measured. Results suggest that reproductive activity is stimulated under high pCO 2 levels. Parental pairs in the simulated ocean acidification conditions exhibited increased reproductive output, with 50% more clutches and 44% more eggs per clutch than pairs under control conditions. However, there was an apparent trade-off between offspring number and size, as larvae of parental pairs under high pCO 2 levels hatched significantly smaller, suggesting differences in parental provisioning, which could be related to the fact that these females produce more eggs. Moreover, results support the hypothesis of different energy allocation strategies used by females under high pCO 2 conditions. These changes might, ultimately, affect individual fitness and population replenishment.", "title": "Reproductive trade-offs in a temperate reef fish under high p CO 2 levels", "query": "Reproductive trade-offs in a temperate reef fish under high p CO 2 levels"}

In the Mediterranean Sea, Petrosia ficiformis is one of the species most affected by temperature-related diseases. Our study aimed to assess its genetic structure, connectivity, and bottleneck signatures to understand its evolutionary history and to provide information to help design conservation strategies of sessile marine invertebrates. Results: We genotyped 280 individuals from 19 locations across the entire distribution range of P. ficiformis in the Atlanto-Mediterranean region at 10 microsatellite loci. High levels of inbreeding were detected in most locations (especially in the Macaronesia and the Western Mediterranean) and bottleneck signatures were only detected in Mediterranean populations, although not coinciding entirely with those with reported die-offs. We detected strong significant population differentiation, with the Atlantic populations being the most genetically isolated, and show that six clusters explained the genetic structure along the distribution range of this sponge. Although we detected a pattern of isolation by distance in P. ficiformis when all locations were analyzed together, stratified Mantel tests revealed that other factors could be playing a more prominent role than isolation by distance. Indeed, we detected a strong effect of oceanographic barriers impeding the gene flow among certain areas, the strongest one being the Almeria-Oran front, hampering gene flow between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. Finally, migration and genetic diversity distribution analyses suggest a Mediterranean origin for the species. Conclusions: In our study Petrosia ficiformis showed extreme levels of inbreeding and population differentiation, which could all be linked to the poor swimming abilities of the larva. However, the observed moderate migration patterns are highly difficult to reconcile with such poor larval dispersal, and suggest that, although unlikely, dispersal may also be achieved in the gamete phase. Overall, because of the high genetic diversity in the Eastern Mediterranean and frequent mass mortalities in the Western Mediterranean, we suggest that conservation efforts should be carried out specifically in those areas of the Mediterranean to safeguard the genetic diversity of the species.", "title": "Genetic diversity, connectivity and gene flow along the distribution of the emblematic Atlanto-Mediterranean sponge Petrosia ficiformis (Haplosclerida, Demospongiae)", "query": "Genetic diversity, connectivity and gene flow along the distribution of the emblematic Atlanto-Mediterranean sponge Petrosia ficiformis (Haplosclerida, Demospongiae)"}

Calibration and validation of these measurements is challenging because satellite and in situ methods measure salinity differently. Microwave radiometers measure the salinity in the top few centimeters of the ocean, whereas most in situ observations are reported below a depth of a few meters. Additionally, satellites measure salinity as a spatial average over an area of about 100 \u00d7 100 km2. In contrast, in situ sensors provide pointwise measurements at the location of the sensor. Thus, the presence of vertical gradients in, and horizontal variability of, sea surface salinity complicates comparison of satellite and in situ measurements. This paper synthesizes present knowledge of the magnitude and the processes that contribute to the formation and evolution of vertical and horizontal variability in near-surface salinity. Rainfall, freshwater plumes, and evaporation can generate vertical gradients of salinity, and in some cases these gradients can be large enough to affect validation of satellite measurements. Similarly, mesoscale to submesoscale processes can lead to horizontal variability that can also affect comparisons of satellite data to in situ data. Comparisons between satellite and in situ salinity measurements must take into account both vertical stratification and horizontal variability.", "title": "Satellite and In Situ Salinity: Understanding Near-Surface Stratification and Subfootprint Variability", "query": "Satellite and In Situ Salinity: Understanding Near-Surface Stratification and Subfootprint Variability"}

The equation was derived by multiple linear regression (MLR) from nitrate, sea surface temperature (SST) observational data and model mixed layer depth (MLD) data. The observational data were taken from merchant vessels that have crossed the North Atlantic on a regular basis in 2002/2003 and from 2005 to the present. It is important to find a robust and realistic estimate of MLD because the deepening of the mixed layer is crucial for nitrate supply to the surface. We compared model data from two models (FOAM and Mercator) with MLD derived from float data (using various criteria). The Mercator model gives a MLD estimate that is close to the MLD derived from floats. MLR was established using SST, MLD from Mercator, time and latitude as predictors. Additionally a neural network was trained with the same dataset and the results were validated against both model data as a \\ground truth\\ and an independent observational dataset.

We measured the photo-physiology, growth (lateral growth, budding and calcification), oxidative stress and activities of carbonic anhydrase (CA), Ca-ATPase and Mg-ATPase. Results showed that while OA enhanced the photochemical performance of in hospite symbionts, it also increased catalase activity and lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, both OA treatments altered the activities of host and symbiont CA, suggesting functional changes in the uptake of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) for photosynthesis and calcification. Most importantly, only the fluctuating OA treatment resulted in a slight drop in calcification with concurrent upregulation of Ca-ATPase and Mg-ATPase, implying increased energy expenditure on calcification. Consequently, asexual budding rates decreased by 50% under fluctuating OA.

GRANTSISM was successfully used in noncompulsory courses in which students have been able to reproduce paleo-ice sheet evolution scenarios discussed here as examples. Students progressed further by designing, developing, and analyzing their own modeling scenarios. Here, we describe GRANTSISM and report on how learning activities with GRANTSISM were assessed by students who had no prior experience in ice sheet modeling. The response rate for a noncompulsory survey of the learning activity was less than 40%. A subsequent control experiment with a compulsory survey, however, showed the same patterns of answers, so the student response is considered representative. First, GRANTSISM is concluded to be a highly attractive tool to introduce learners with an interest in ice sheet behavior to ice sheet modeling. Second, it triggers an interest for more in-depth learning experiences related to numerical ice sheet modeling.", "title": "GRANTSISM: An Excel\u2122 ice sheet model for use in introductory Earth science courses", "query": "GRANTSISM: An Excel\u2122 ice sheet model for use in introductory Earth science courses"}

We collected seasonally resolved larval abundance and gut content as well as zooplankton data, with the goal of identifying mechanisms leading to variability in larval survival. Our results show sprat larvae feed progressively on larger food items as they grow during the season depending on their size and the composition of the available prey. We found first-feeding larvae early in the spawning season to prey exclusively upon microplankton. Small larvae fed mainly upon nauplii of the copepods Acartia spp., Temora longicornis and Centropages hamatus (ca. 65%), whereas larger larvae consumed up to 80% Acartia spp. copepodites and adults, as well as cladocerans. Trends in sprat larval diets were to a large degree explainable by selective feeding. Feeding success and gut fullness increased linearly with larval size. Trophic niche breadth increased linearly until larvae reached a predator size of 16 mm, after which it decreased. We explain the latter decline by a restricted size spectrum of prey available to larger sprat larvae, which points towards the importance of considering the structure of the zooplankton community when evaluating the predator size to niche breadth relationship. Our results suggest first-feeding Baltic sprat larvae to be always food-limited, while larger larvae are not. We hypothesize medium-sized sprat larvae to be the life stage that has the potential to cause most of the interannual variability in sprat larval survival, which is dependent on a match between larval production and the state of the plankton cycle.", "title": "Feeding ecology of Central Baltic sprat Sprattus sprattus larvae in relation to zooplankton dynamics: implications for survival", "query": "Feeding ecology of Central Baltic sprat Sprattus sprattus larvae in relation to zooplankton dynamics: implications for survival"}

In contrast, we investigate large-scale fish diversity on the basis of multiple diversity indices and using 1454 standardized trawl hauls collected throughout the upper and middle slope of the whole northern Mediterranean Sea (36u39-45u79 N; 5u39W -28uE). We have analyzed (1) the empirical relationships between a set of 11 diversity indices in order to assess their degree of complementarity/redundancy and (2) the consistency of spatial patterns exhibited by each of the complementary groups of indices. Regarding species richness, our results contrasted both the traditional view based on the hump-shaped theory for bathymetric pattern and the commonly-admitted hypothesis of a large-scale decreasing trend correlated with a similar gradient of primary production in the Mediterranean Sea. More generally, we found that the components of slope fish diversity we analyzed did not always show a consistent pattern of distribution according either to depth or to spatial areas, suggesting that they are not driven by the same factors. These results, which stress the need to extend the number of indices traditionally considered in diversity monitoring networks, could provide a basis for rethinking not only the methodological approach used in monitoring systems, but also the definition of priority zones for protection.

Already today, coastal regions experience episodic pH events during which surface layer pH drops below values projected for the surface ocean at the end of the century. Future OA is expected to further enhance the intensity of these coastal extreme pH events. To evaluate the influence of such episodic OA events in coastal regions, we deployed eight pelagic mesocosms for 53 days in Raunefjord, Norway, and enclosed 56\u201361 m3 of local seawater containing a natural plankton community under nutrient limited post-bloom conditions. Four mesocosms were enriched with CO2 to simulate extreme pCO2 levels of 1978 \u2013 2069 \u03bcatm while the other four served as untreated controls. Here, we present results from multivariate analyses on OA-induced changes in the phyto-, micro-, and mesozooplankton community structure. Pronounced differences in the plankton community emerged early in the experiment, and were amplified by enhanced top-down control throughout the study period. The plankton groups responding most profoundly to high CO2 conditions were cyanobacteria (negative), chlorophyceae (negative), auto- and heterotrophic microzooplankton (negative), and a variety of mesozooplanktonic taxa, including copepoda (mixed), appendicularia (positive), hydrozoa (positive), fish larvae (positive), and gastropoda (negative). The restructuring of the community coincided with significant changes in the concentration and elemental stoichiometry of particulate organic matter. Results imply that extreme CO2 events can lead to a substantial reorganization of the planktonic food web, affecting multiple trophic levels from phytoplankton to primary and secondary consumers.

Resultant increases in light availability may enhance phytoplankton production. Direct evidence for factors currently constraining summertime phytoplankton growth in the Arctic region is however lacking. GEOTRACES cruise GN05 conducted a Fram Strait transect from Svalbard to the NE Greenland Shelf in summer 2016, sampling for bioessential trace metals (Fe, Co, Zn, Mn) and macronutrients (N, Si, P) at ~ 79\u00b0N. Five bioassay experiments were conducted to establish phytoplankton responses to additions of Fe, N, Fe + N and volcanic dust. Ambient nutrient concentrations suggested N and Fe were deficient in surface seawater relative to typical phytoplankton requirements. A west-to-east trend in the relative deficiency of N and Fe was apparent, with N becoming more deficient towards Greenland and Fe more deficient towards Svalbard. This aligned with phytoplankton responses in bioassay experiments, which showed greatest chlorophyll-a increases in + N treatment near Greenland and + N + Fe near Svalbard. Collectively these results suggest primary N limitation of phytoplankton growth throughout the study region, with conditions potentially approaching secondary Fe limitation in the eastern Fram Strait. We suggest that the supply of Atlantic-derived N and Arctic-derived Fe exerts a strong control on summertime nutrient stoichiometry and resultant limitation patterns across the Fram Strait region.

Conclusions: Both Baikal species possess intact stress response systems and respond to elevated temperature with relatively similar changes in their expression profiles.

Their deployment was designed to address the acidification effects of CO2 levels from 400 to 1,400 mu atm, on a plankton community experiencing upwelling of nutrient-rich deep water. Among other parameters, chlorophyll a (chl-a), potential respiration (Phi), and biomass in terms of particulate protein (B) were measured in the microplankton community (0.7-50.0 mu m) during an oligotrophic phase (Phase I), a phytoplankton-bloom phase (Phase II), and a post-bloom phase (Phase III). Here, we explore the use of the Phi/chl-a ratio in monitoring shifts in the microplankton community composition and its metabolism. Phi/chl-a values below 2.5 mu L O-2 h(-1) (mu g chl-a)(-1) indicated a community dominated by photoautotrophs. When Phi/chl-a ranged higher, between 2.5 and 7.0 mu L O-2 h(-1) (pg chl-a)(-1) , it indicated a mixed community of phytoplankton, microzooplankton and heterotrophic prokaryotes. When Phi/chl-a rose above 7.0 mu L O-2 h(-1) (mu g chl-a)(-1), it indicated a community where microzooplankton proliferated (>10.0 mu L O-2 h(-1) (mu g chl-a)(-1)), because heterotrophic dinoflagellates bloomed. The first derivative of B, as a function of time (dB/dt), indicates the rate of protein build-up when positive and the rate of protein loss, when negative. It revealed that the maximum increase in particulate protein (biomass) occurred between 1 and 2 days before the chl-a peak. A day after this peak, the trough revealed the maximum net biomass loss. This analysis did not detect significant changes in particulate protein, neither in Phase I nor in Phase III. Integral analysis of Phi/chl-a and B, over the duration of each phase, for each mesocosm, reflected a positive relationship between 4) and pCO(2) during Phase II [alpha = 230.10-5 mu L O-2 h(-1) L-1 (patm CO2)(-1) (phase-day)(-1), R-2 = 0.30] and between chl-a and pCO(2) during Phase III [alpha = 100.10(-5) Ag chl-a L-1 (mu atmCO(2))(-1) (phase-day)(-1), R-2 = 0.84]. At the end of Phase II, a harmful algal species (HAS), Vicicitus globosus, bloomed in the high pCO(2) mesocosms. In these mesocosms, microzooplankton did not proliferate, and chl-a retention time in the water column increased. In these V globosus-disrupted communities, the (Phi/chl-a ratio [4.1 +/- 1.5 /mu L O-2 h(-1) (mu g chl-a)(-1)] was more similar to the Phi/chl-a ratio in a mixed plankton community than to a photoautotroph-dominated one.", "title": "Metabolic Responses of Subtropical Microplankton After a Simulated Deep-Water Upwelling Event Suggest a Possible Dominance of Mixotrophy Under Increasing CO2 Levels", "query": "Metabolic Responses of Subtropical Microplankton After a Simulated Deep-Water Upwelling Event Suggest a Possible Dominance of Mixotrophy Under Increasing CO2 Levels"}

The high concentration of these unsaturated fatty acids in shallow water sediments shows the recent deposition of the organic material. In deep-sea sediments, on the other hand, the concentrations are low. This decreased content is typical for phytoplankton material which has been degraded by microorganisms or autoxidation.

The objective of this paper is to reconstruct the palaeoenvironmental variability and to infer major palaeoclimate trends that have occurred since ~13.3 cal. kyr BP. We analysed the diatom assemblages, sedimentology (grain-size, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN)), and the elemental and mineralogical composition using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and X-ray diffractometry (XRD) of the sediment core. Our results show parallel changes in the diatom species composition and sediment characteristics. Enhanced minerogenic sediment input and the occurrence of pyrite is indicative of a cold period between ~12.7 and 11.6 cal. kyr BP. The diatom data enable a qualitative inference about the local ecological conditions to be made, and reveal an oligotrophic lake system with alkaline and cold conditions during the earliest Holocene. Moderately warmer climates are inferred for the period from ~9.1 to 5.7 cal. kyr BP. The major shift in the diatom assemblage, from dominance of small benthic fragilarioid taxa to a more complex diatom flora with an influx of several achnanthoid and naviculoid diatom species, occurred after a transitional period of about 1400 yr (7.1 to 5.7 cal. kyr BP) at ~5.7 cal. kyr BP, indicating a circumneutral and warmer hydrological regime during the Holocene thermal maximum (HTM). Diatom valve concentrations declined starting ~2.8 cal. kyr BP, but have been rising again since \u2264 600 cal. yr BP. This has occurred in parallel to the increased presence of acidophilous diatom taxa (e.g. Eunotia spp.) and decreased presence of small benthic fragilarioid species in the most recent sediments, which is interpreted as the result of neoglacial cooling and subsequent recent climate warming.

Nonetheless, not all species are vulnerable to those OA threats, e.g. some species may be able to cope with OA stress using environmentally induced modifications on gene and protein expressions. For example, external environmental stressors including OA can influence the addition and removal of methyl groups through epigenetic modification (e.g. DNA methylation) process to turn gene expression \\on or off\\ as part of a rapid adaptive mechanism to cope with OA. In this study, we tested the above hypothesis through testing the effect of OA, using decreased pH 7.4 as proxy, on DNA methylation pattern of an endemic and a commercially important estuary oyster species, Crassostrea hongkongensis at the time of larval habitat selection and metamorphosis. Larval growth rate did not differ between control pH 8.1 and treatment pH 7.4.

We here present the first regional data set on particulate Nd isotope compositions (\u03b5 Nd p ) and concentrations ([Nd] p ) from five stations in the western North Atlantic Ocean along the GEOTRACES GA02 transect, in conjunction with previously published dissolved Nd isotope compositions (\u03b5 Nd d ) and concentrations ([Nd] d ) 1 .

(2) Increasing Nd concentrations in suspended particulate matter ([Nd] SPM ) and fractions of lithogenic material with water depth, suggesting the removal of Nd poor phases. (3) Different provenances of particulates in the subpolar and subtropical gyres as evidenced by their Nd isotope fingerprints reaching from \u03b5 Nd p \u2248 -20 near the Labrador Basin (old continental crust), over \u03b5 Nd p \u2248 -4 between Iceland and Greenland (young mafic provenance), to values of \u03b5 Nd p \u2248-13 in the subtropics (similar to African dust signal).

In order to answer this question, we explore results from an ocean biogeochemical general circulation model. We attempt to systematically reconcile model results with time-dependent sediment core data from the observations. For this purpose, we fit simulated sensitivities of oceanic tracer concentrations to changes in governing carbon cycle parameters to measured sediment core data. We assume that the time variation in the governing carbon cycle parameters follows the general pattern of the glacial-interglacial deuterium anomaly. Our analysis provides an independent estimate of a maximum mean sea surface temperature drawdown of about 5 \u2022 C and a maximum outgassing of the land biosphere by about 430 Pg C at the Last Glacial Maximum as compared to pre-industrial times. The overall fit of modelled palaeoclimate tracers to observations, however, remains quite weak, indicating the potential of more detailed modelling studies to fully exploit the information stored in the palaeoclimatic archive. This study confirms the hypothesis that a decline in ocean temperature and a more efficient biological carbon pump in combination with changes in ocean circulation are the key factors for explaining the glacial CO 2 drawdown. The analysis suggests that potential changes in the export rain ratio POC : CaCO 3 may not have a substantial imprint on the palaeoclimatic archive.

Four of these exhibit distinctive phenotypes characterized by greatly reduced optic globes deeply embedded into the head (cryptophthalmia) and reduced (or absent) melanin pigmentation, among other characteristics. A strikingly similar cryptophthalmic phenotype is also found in members of a number of unrelated fish families, strongly suggesting the possibility of convergent evolution. However, little is known about the evolutionary processes that shaped diversification in LCR Mastacembelus, their biogeographic origins, or when colonization of the LCR occurred. Methods: We sequenced mitochondrial and nuclear genes from Mastacembelus species collected in the lower Congo River, and compared them with other African species and Asian representatives as outgroups. We analyzed the sequence data using Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic inference. Results: Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic analyses, and Bayesian coalescent methods for species tree reconstruction, reveal that endemic LCR spiny eels derive from two independent origins, clearly demonstrating convergent evolution of the cryptophthalmic phenotype. Mastacembelus crassus, M. aviceps, and M. simbi form a clade, allied to species found in southern, eastern and central Africa. Unexpectedly, M. brichardi and brachyrhinus fall within a clade otherwise endemic to Lake Tanganikya (LT) ca. 1500 km east of the LCR. Divergence dating suggests the ages of these two clades of LCR endemics differ markedly. The age of the crassus group is estimated at ~4 Myr while colonization of the LCR by the brichardi-brachyrhinus progenitor was considerably more recent, dated at ~0.5 Myr. Conclusions: The phylogenetic framework of spiny eels presented here, the first to include LCR species, demonstrates that cryptophthalmia and associated traits evolved at least twice in Mastacembelus: once in M. brichardi and at least once in the M. crassus clade. Timing of diversification is broadly consistent with the onset of modern high-energy flow conditions in the LCR and with previous studies of endemic cichlids. The close genetic relationship between M. brichardi and M. brachyrhinus is particularly notable given the extreme difference in phenotype between these species, and additional work is needed to better understand the evolutionary history of diversification in this clade. The findings presented here demonstrate strong, multi-trait convergence in LCR spiny eels, suggesting that extreme selective pressures have shaped numerous phenotypic attributes of the endemic species of this region.", "title": "Molecular phylogenetics reveals convergent evolution in lower Congo River spiny eels", "query": "Molecular phylogenetics reveals convergent evolution in lower Congo River spiny eels"}

Based on the concept of oxygen and capacity-limited thermal tolerance, the following hypothesis was tested: ocean warming and acidification (OWA) would induce disturbances in aerobic metabolic scope and extracellular acid-case status and impair swimming performance in temperate scallops. Following longterm incubation under near-future OWA scenarios [20 vs. 10 \u00b0C (control) and 0.112 kPa CO2 (hypercapnia) vs. 0.040 kPa CO2 (normocapnic control)], the clapping performance and metabolic rates (MR) were measured in resting (RMR) and fatigued (maximum MR) king scallops, Pecten maximus, from Roscoff, France. Exposure to OA, either alone or combined with warming, left MR and swimming parameters such as the total number of claps and clapping forces virtually unchanged. Only the duration of the escape response was affected by OA which caused earlier exhaustion in hyper- than in normocapnic scallops at 10 \u00b0C. While maximum MR was unaffected, warm exposure increased RMR in both normocapnic and hypercapnic P. maximus resulting in similar Q10 values of ~2.2. The increased costs of maintenance and the observation of strongly reduced haemolymph PO2 levels indicate that at 20 \u00b0C scallops have reached the upper thermal pejus range with unbalanced capacities for aerobic energy metabolism. As a consequence, warming to 20 \u00b0C decreased mean phasic force during escape performance until fatigue. The observed prolonged recovery time in warm incubated scallops might be a consequence of elevated metabolic costs at reduced oxygen availability in the warmth.", "title": "Escape performance of temperate king scallop, Pecten maximus under ocean warming and acidification", "query": "Escape performance of temperate king scallop, Pecten maximus under ocean warming and acidification"}

However, nearly all biogenic carbonates undergo post-mortem diagenetic alteration to variable degrees. Diagenetic features are essentially caused by complex fluid-solid interaction including recrystallization and neomorphosis of shell architecture and related geochemical resetting. A common conception is that a given primary shell texture is replaced by a secondary fabric via micro-scale dissolution-reprecipitation reactions that may reach geochemical and/or isotopic equilibrium with the diagenetic fluid. Here we document that the process of petrographic and geochemical alteration of a biogenic carbonate archive progresses stepwise, and the re-equilibration processes can be separated in space and time. More specifically, attached and bound aqueous fluids within the shell organic matter and fluid inclusions likely play a crucial role in the early stages of alteration within a relatively rock-buffered system. Degradation of organics was observed via decreased sulfur concentration and decreased fluorescence. In this early stage of alteration, the conversion of micro-scale aragonite biominerals to metastable diagenetic calcite (meso)crystals is documented by RAMAN spectroscopy, electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and a decrease in strontium concentrations. Further stabilization to larger, neomorphosed calcite crystals resulted from re-equilibration with external fluids and was evidenced by EBSD, oxygen isotope data, and further reduction of strontium. Spatial chemical and isotope data were used to decipher the impact of fluid availability and transfer behavior, i.e. carbonate-buffered versus diagenetic-fluid buffered, and isotope and element exchange behavior, and analyzed in context to textural alteration features. These data suggest that during diagenesis, the evolution to more sustainable (diagenetically induced) fabrics is accompanied by individual reaction steps traced by elemental and isotopic signatures. Kinetics, and thus degree of diagenetic alteration of biominerals at a given exposure to physicochemical alteration conditions is initially strongly controlled by the micro-to nano-scale internal architecture governing the availability and transfer of aqueous fluids. Results shown here have significance for those concerned with biogenic carbonate archives and have wider implications for a mechanistic understanding of carbonate diagenesis.", "title": "Diagenesis of mollusc aragonite and the role of fluid reservoirs", "query": "Diagenesis of mollusc aragonite and the role of fluid reservoirs"}

Timing of maturation in both reciprocal hybrid crosses between the two populations was similar to that in the marine population, suggesting that early timing of maturation is a dominant trait, whereas delayed timing of maturation in the pond is a recessive trait.

Significant differences in spatial (seamount vs. open ocean) and depth-resolved patterns (0-400 m vs. 400-1000m) pointed to additional complexity, and raise questions about the extent of connectivity between locations and differential patterns in vertical coupling between gelatinous zooplankton groups. Added complexity also resulted from inconsistent patterns in trophic ontogenetic shifts among groups.

We used pigment and gene fingerprinting in combination with flow cytometry for classification and quantification of the taxon-specific photoautotrophic response to differences in nutrient supply. The developing primary bloom was dominated by diatoms and was significantly higher in the treatments receiving initial N addition. The combined supply of N and P did not induce a further increase in phytoplankton abundance compared to high N addition alone. A secondary bloom during the course of the experiment again displayed higher primary producer standing stock in the N-fertilized treatments. Bacterial abundance correlated positively with phytoplankton biomass. Dominance of the photoautotrophic assemblage by N-limited diatoms in conjunction with a probable absence of any P-limited phytoplankton species prevented an additive effect of combined N and P addition on total phytoplankton biomass.

The intensity of this important carbon sink varies considerably on inter-annual to decadal timescales. However, the drivers of this variability are still debated, challenging our ability to accurately predict the future role of the Southern Ocean in absorbing atmospheric carbon. Analysing mapped sea-air CO2 fluxes, estimated from upscaled surface ocean CO2 measurements, we find that the overall Southern Ocean carbon sink has weakened since ~2011, reversing the trend of the reinvigoration period of the 2000s. Although we find significant regional positive and negative responses of the Southern Ocean carbon uptake to changes in the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) over the past 35 years, the net effect of the SAM on the Southern Ocean carbon sink variability is approximately zero, due to the opposing effects of enhanced outgassing in upwelling regions and enhanced carbon uptake elsewhere. Instead, regional shifts in sea level pressure, linked to zonal wavenumber 3 (ZW3) and related changes in surface winds substantially contribute to the inter-annual to decadal variability of the Southern Ocean carbon sink.", "title": "Regional Wind Variability Modulates the Southern Ocean Carbon Sink", "query": "Regional Wind Variability Modulates the Southern Ocean Carbon Sink"}

We used a thermistor chain with the additional ability to record the temperature response induced by cyclic heating of resistors embedded in the chain. Vertical sea-ice temperature and heating profiles obtained daily between November 2012 and February 2014 were analyzed to determine sea-ice and snow evolution, and to calculate the basal energy budget. The residual heat flux translated into an ice-volume fraction in the platelet layer of 0.18 6 0.09, which we reproduced by a independent model simulation and agrees with earlier results. Manual drillings revealed an average annual platelet-layer thickness increase of at least 4 m, and an annual maximum thickness of 10 m beneath second-year sea ice. The oceanic contribution dominated the total sea-ice production during the study, effectively accounting for up to 70% of second-year sea-ice growth. In summer, an oceanic heat flux of 21 W m 22 led to a partial thinning of the platelet layer. Our results further show that the active heating method, in contrast to the acoustic sounding approach, is well suited to derive the fast-ice mass balance in regions influenced by ocean/ice-shelf interaction, as it allows subdiurnal monitoring of the platelet-layer thickness.", "title": "Seasonal evolution of an ice-shelf influenced fast-ice regime, derived from an autonomous thermistor chain", "query": "Seasonal evolution of an ice-shelf influenced fast-ice regime, derived from an autonomous thermistor chain"}

This is especially true for ice-covered Arctic ocean where surface navigation is only possible during the summer period. Moreover, safe underwater navigation in icy waters requires the capability of detecting sea ice on the surface (ice sheets). AUVs navigating in such conditions risk collisions, RF communication shadowing, and being trapped by ice keels. In this paper, an underwater sea-ice detection apparatus is described.

The detector is composed of a polarizing beam splitter, which separates light of S and P polarization states and two photodetectors, one for each polarized component. Since sea-ice is a strong depolarizer, the ratio P/S is an indicator of the presence or absence of sea-ice. The system is capable of detecting sea-ice at a distance of 12m.

Pore-water profiles indicated considerable variation in upward methane (CH 4 ) flow among sediment cores taken along the transect, with highest flux in the seep sediment core, gradually decreasing along the transect, to no CH 4 flux in the core taken at a 5 m distance. Low sulphate concentrations and high levels of total alkalinity and sulphide (H 2 S) suggested that anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) occurred close to the sediment surface in the seep sediment core. High H 2 S levels had a genus-and species-specific impact on meiofaunal densities. Nematode genus composition varied gradually between sediment cores, with the genus Sabatieria dominating almost all sediment cores.

The activities of microbial extracellular enzymes hydrolyzing 4 polysaccharides were measured during the development of a natural phytoplankton bloom under pCO2 conditions representing glacial (190 \u00b5atm) and future (750 \u00b5atm) atmospheric pCO2. We observed that (1) chondroitin hydrolysis was variable throughout the pre-, early-and late-bloom phases, (2) fucoidanase activity was measurable only in the glacial mesocosm as the bloom developed, (3) laminarinase activity was low and constant, and (4) xylanase activity declined as the bloom progressed. Concurrent measurements of microbial community composition, using denaturing-gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), showed that the 2 mesocosms diverged temporally, and from one another, especially in the late-bloom phase. Enzyme activities correlated with bloom phase and pCO2, suggesting functional as well as compositional changes in microbial communities in the different pCO2 environments. These changes, however, may be a response to temporal changes in the development of phytoplankton communities that differed with the pCO2 environment. We hypothesize that the phytoplankton communities produced dissolved organic carbon (DOC) differing in composition, a hypothesis supported by changing amino acid composition of the DOC, and that enzyme activities responded to changes in substrates. Enzyme activities observed under different pCO2 conditions likely reflect both genetic and population-level responses to changes occurring among multiple components of the microbial loop.

High primary production followed by rapid heterotrophic utilization of organic matter supports the formation of one of the most intense oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) in the world ocean, where dissolved oxygen (O 2 ) concentrations reach less than 1 \u00b5mol kg \u22121 . The high productivity leads to an accumulation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the surface layers that may serve as a substrate for heterotrophic respiration. However, the importance of DOM utilization for O 2 respiration in the Peruvian upwelling system in general and for shaping the upper oxycline in particular remains unclear so far. This study reports the first estimates of diapycnal fluxes and supply of O 2 , dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen, dissolved hydrolysable amino acids (DHAA) and dissolved combined carbohydrates (DCCHO) for the ETSP off Peru. Diapycnal flux and supply estimates were obtained by combining measured vertical diffusivities and solute concentration gradients. They were analysed together with the molecular composition of DCCHO and DHAA to infer the transport of labile DOM into the upper OMZ and the potential role of DOM utilization for the attenuation of the diapycnal O 2 flux that ventilates the OMZ. The observed diapycnal O 2 flux (50 mmol O 2 m \u22122 d \u22121 at maximum) was limited to the upper 80 m of the water column; the O 2 supply of \u223c 1 \u00b5mol kg \u22121 d \u22121 was comparable to previously published O 2 consumption rates for the North and South Pacific OMZs. The diapycnal DOM flux (31 mmol C m \u22122 d \u22121 at maximum) was limited to \u223c 30 m water depth, suggesting that the labile DOM is extensively consumed within the upper part of the shallow oxycline off Peru. The analyses of DCCHO and DHAA composition support this finding, suggesting that DOM undergoes comprehensive remineralization within the upper part of the oxycline, as the DOM within the core of the OMZ was found to be largely altered. Estimated by a simple equation for carbon combustion, aerobic respiration of DCCHO and DHAA, supplied by diapycnal mixing (0.46 \u00b5mol kg \u22121 d \u22121 at maximum), could account for up to 38 % of the diapycnal O 2 supply in the upper oxycline, which suggests that DOM utilization plays a significant role for shaping the upper oxycline in the ETSP.", "title": "Diapycnal dissolved organic matter supply into the upper Peruvian oxycline", "query": "Diapycnal dissolved organic matter supply into the upper Peruvian oxycline"}

We present here the first results, for the preindustrial and mid-Holocene climatological periods, of the newly developed isotope-enhanced version of the fully coupled Earth system model MPI-ESM, called hereafter MPI-ESM-wiso. The water stable isotopes H 2 16 O , H 2 18 O and HDO have been implemented into all components of the coupled model setup. The mid-Holocene provides the opportunity to evaluate the model response to changes in the seasonal and latitudinal distribution of insolation induced by different orbital forcing conditions. The results of our equilibrium simulations allow us to evaluate the performance of the isotopic model in simulating the spatial and temporal variations of water isotopes in the different compartments of the hydrological system for warm climates. For the preindustrial climate, MPI-ESM-wiso reproduces very well the observed spatial distribution of the isotopic content in precipitation linked to the spatial variations in temperature and precipitation rate. We also find a good model\u2013data agreement with the observed distribution of isotopic composition in surface seawater but a bias with the presence of surface seawater that is too 18O -depleted in the Arctic Ocean. All these results are improved compared to the previous model version ECHAM5/MPIOM. The spatial relationships of water isotopic composition with temperature, precipitation rate and salinity are consistent with observational data. For the preindustrial climate, the interannual relationships of water isotopes with temperature and salinity are globally lower than the spatial ones, consistent with previous studies. Simulated results under mid-Holocene conditions are in fair agreement with the isotopic measurements from ice cores and continental speleothems. MPI-ESM-wiso simulates a decrease in the isotopic composition of precipitation from North Africa to the Tibetan Plateau via India due to the enhanced monsoons during the mid-Holocene. Over Greenland, our simulation indicates a higher isotopic composition of precipitation linked to higher summer temperature and a reduction in sea ice, shown by positive isotope\u2013temperature gradient. For the Antarctic continent, the model simulates lower isotopic values over the East Antarctic plateau, linked to the lower temperatures during the mid-Holocene period, while similar or higher isotopic values are modeled over the rest of the continent. While variations of isotopic contents in precipitation over West Antarctica between mid-Holocene and preindustrial periods are partly controlled by changes in temperature, the transport of relatively 18O -rich water vapor near the coast to the western ice core sites could play a role in the final isotopic composition. So, more caution has to be taken about the reconstruction of past temperature variations during warm periods over this area. The coupling of such a model with an ice sheet model or the use of a zoomed grid centered on this region could help to better describe the role of the water vapor transport and sea ice around West Antarctica. The reconstruction of past salinity through isotopic content in sea surface waters can be complicated for regions with strong ocean dynamics, variations in sea ice regimes or significant changes in freshwater budget, giving an extremely variable relationship between the isotopic content and salinity of ocean surface waters over small spatial scales. These complicating factors demonstrate the complexity of interpreting water isotopes as past climate signals of warm periods like the mid-Holocene. A systematic isotope model intercomparison study for further insights on the model dependency of these results would be beneficial.", "title": "Water isotopes \u2013 climate relationships for the mid-Holocene and preindustrial period simulated with an isotope-enabled version of MPI-ESM", "query": "Water isotopes \u2013 climate relationships for the mid-Holocene and preindustrial period simulated with an isotope-enabled version of MPI-ESM"}

In this region, the mixed layer heat budget is characterized by a strong annual cycle mainly modulated by the shortwave radiation annual cycle. During the austral fall and winter, the shortwave radiation input minimum is overwhelmed by the heat loss mainly because of the latent heat flux. The mixed layer salt budget also presents a strong annual cycle with a minimum of salt content during the late austral winter. In contrast with the heat budget, the salt budget is mainly driven by the unresolved terms computed as the residual of the budget. Among these missing terms, the most likely candidate is the vertical turbulent mixing as a result of convection caused by the heat surface buoyancy loss and the destabilizing vertical gradient of salinity at the base of the mixed layer. This downward flux of salt at the base of the mixed layer could explain the annual spiciness injection and interannual spiciness variability in the permanent thermocline in the southeastern Pacific.", "title": "Variability of the Heat and Salt Budget in the Subtropical Southeastern Pacific Mixed Layer between 2004 and 2010: Spice Injection Mechanism", "query": "Variability of the Heat and Salt Budget in the Subtropical Southeastern Pacific Mixed Layer between 2004 and 2010: Spice Injection Mechanism"}

Infrastructure built on perennially frozen ice-rich ground relies heavily on thermally stable subsurface conditions. Climate warming-induced deepening of ground thaw puts such infrastructure at risk of failure. For better assessing the risk of large-scale future damage to Arctic infrastructure, improved strategies for model-based approaches are urgently needed. We used the laterally-coupled one-dimensional heat conduction model CryoGrid3 to simulate permafrost degradation affected by linear infrastructure. We present a case study of a gravel road built on continuous permafrost (Dalton highway, Alaska) and forced our model under historical and strong future warming conditions (following the RCP8.5 scenario). As expected, the presence of a gravel road in the model leads to higher net heat flux entering the ground compared to a reference run without infrastructure, and thus a higher rate of thaw. Further, our results suggest that road failure is likely a consequence of lateral destabilization due to talik formation in the ground beside the road, rather than a direct consequence of a top-down thawing and deepening of the active layer below the road centre. In line with previous studies, we identify enhanced snow accumulation and ponding (both a consequence of infrastructure presence) as key factors for increased soil temperatures and road degradation. Using differing horizontal model resolutions we show that it is possible to capture these key factors and their impact on thawing dynamics with a low number of lateral model units, underlining the potential of our model approach for use in pan-arctic risk assessments. Our results suggest a general two-phase behaviour of permafrost degradation: an initial phase of slow and gradual thaw, followed by a strong increase in thawing rates after exceedance of a critical ground warming. The timing of this transition and the magnitude of thaw rate acceleration differ strongly between undisturbed tundra and infrastructure-affected permafrost ground. Our model results suggest that current model-based approaches which do not explicitly take into account infrastructure in their designs are likely to strongly underestimate the timing of future Arctic infrastructure failure. By using a laterally-coupled one-dimensional model to simulate linear infrastructure, we infer results in line with outcomes from more complex 2D- and 3D-models, but our model's computational efficiency allows us to account for long-term climate change impacts on infrastructure from permafrost degradation. Our model simulations underline that it is crucial to consider climate warming when planning and constructing infrastructure on permafrost as a transition from a stable to a highly unstable state can well occur within the service life time (about 30 years) of such a construction. Such a transition can even be triggered in the coming decade by climate change for infrastructure built on high northern latitude continuous permafrost that displays cold and relatively stable conditions today.", "title": "Consequences of permafrost degradation for Arctic infrastructure \u2013 bridging the model gap between regional and engineering scales", "query": "Consequences of permafrost degradation for Arctic infrastructure \u2013 bridging the model gap between regional and engineering scales"}

Based on velocity and hydrographic measurements carried out along the crest of the Reykjanes Ridge from the Icelandic continental shelf to 50\u00b0N during the RREX cruise in June \u2013 July 2015, we derived the first direct estimates of volume and water mass transports over the Reykjanes Ridge. North of 53.15\u00b0N, circulation was mainly westward; south of this latitude it was mainly eastward. The westward transport was estimated at 21.9 \u00b1 2.5 Sv (Sv = 106 m3 s\u20101) and represents the SPG intensity. The westward flows followed two main pathways at 57\u00b0N near the Bight Fracture Zone and at 59 \u2013 62\u00b0N. We argue that those pathways were connected to the northern branch of the North Atlantic Current and to the Sub\u2010Arctic Front respectively, which were both intersected by the southern part of the section. In addition to this horizontal circulation, mixing and bathymetry shaped the water mass distribution. Water mass transformations in the Iceland Basin lead to the formation of weakly stratified SubPolar Mode Water (SPMW). We explain why SPMW, the main water mass contributing to the westward flow, was denser at 57\u00b0N than at 59 \u2013 62\u00b0N. At higher densities, both Intermediate Water and Icelandic Slope Water contributed more to the westward transport across the Reykjanes Ridge than the sum of Labrador Sea Water and Iceland\u2010Scotland Overflow Water. Plain Language Summary The Reykjanes Ridge, the northern section of the Mid\u2010Atlantic Ridge, strongly influences the cyclonic circulation of the North\u2010Atlantic subpolar gyre, a major component of the climate system. Up to now, no dedicated dataset was available to describe the circulation across this ridge. To fill this gap, surface\u2010to\u2010bottom measurements of flow velocity and water mass properties were carried out along the crest of the ridge, from Iceland to 50{degree sign}N, in 2015. North of 53.15{degree sign}N, the flow was mainly westward. It defines the westward branch of the subpolar gyre and our study provides the first direct estimate of its intensity. The westward flow followed two main pathways related to specific bathymetry features: at the Bight Fracture Zone (57{degree sign}N), which is a deep opening in the ridge, and at 59 \u2010 62{degree sign}N where the bathymetry rapidly deepens southward. The horizontal circulation of the Iceland Basin connects these pathways to the North\u2010Atlantic Current flowing eastward south of 53.15{degree sign}N. Knowledge of the westward cross\u2010ridge flows is a prerequisite for understanding the northward evolution of the Irminger Current, a major conduit for the subtropical waters towards the deep convection regions in the Irminger and Labrador Seas.", "title": "First Direct Estimates of Volume and Water Mass Transports Across the Reykjanes Ridge", "query": "First Direct Estimates of Volume and Water Mass Transports Across the Reykjanes Ridge"}

The metabolite patterns showed minor responses to OA in both life-cycle stages. Whereas previous gene expression analyses suggested that the observed increased biomass buildup derived from lipid and carbohydrate storage, this dataset suggests that OA slightly increases overall biomass of cells, but does not significantly alter their metabolite composition. Generally, light was shown to be a more dominant driver of metabolite composition than OA, increasing the relative abundances of amino acids, mannitol and storage lipids, and shifting pigment contents to accommodate increased irradiance levels. The diploid stage was shown to contain vastly more osmolytes and mannitol than the haploid stage, which in turn had a higher relative content of amino acids, especially aromatic ones.

Surface nudging approaches using standard fixed restoring terms succeed in reproducing most of the target AMOC variability, including the timing of the extreme event, but systematically underestimate its amplitude. A detailed analysis of the AMOC variability mechanisms reveals that the underestimation of the extreme AMOC maximum comes from a deficit in the formation of the dense water masses in the main convection region, located south of Iceland in the model. This issue is largely corrected after introducing a novel surface nudging approach, which uses a varying restoring coefficient that is proportional to the simulated mixed layer depth, which, in essence, keeps the restoring time scale constant. This new technique substantially improves water mass transformation in the regions of convection, and in particular, the formation of the densest waters, which are key for the representation of the AMOC extreme. It is therefore a promising strategy that may help to better constrain the AMOC variability and other ocean features in the models. As this restoring technique only uses surface data, for which better and longer observations are available, it opens up opportunities for improved reconstructions of the AMOC over the last few decades.", "title": "Reconstructing extreme AMOC events through nudging of the ocean surface: a perfect model approach", "query": "Reconstructing extreme AMOC events through nudging of the ocean surface: a perfect model approach"}

Our study had four major outcomes: (i) NCC rates declined in response to nutrient addition in all substrate types, (ii) the mixed community switched from net calcification to net dissolution under medium and high nutrient conditions, (iii) nutrients augmented pH variability through modified photosynthesis and respiration rates, and (iv) nutrients disrupted the relationship between NCC and aragonite saturation state documented in ambient conditions. These results indicate that the negative effect of NO 2 3 and PO 32 4 addition on reef calcification is likely both a direct physiological response to nutrients and also an indirect response to a shifting pH environment from altered NCP rates.

The DT of G. ruber and P. obliquiloculata as well as the alkenone and P. obliquiloculata suggest increased surface water mixing during the late glacial, likely due to enhanced EAWM winds. Surface water mixing was weaker during the late Holocene, indicating a weaker influence of winter monsoon winds. The weakest winter monsoon activity occurred between 6.5 ka and 2.5 ka. Inferred EAWM changes since the Last Glacial Maximum coincide with EAWM changes as recorded in Chinese loess sediments.

Previous research has shed light on factors that can influence egg quality. Large gaps however remain including a comprehensive view of what makes a bad egg. Initial development of the embryo relies on maternallyinherited molecules, such as transcripts, deposited in the egg during its formation. Bad egg quality is therefore susceptible to be associated with alteration or dysregulation of maternally-inherited transcripts. We performed transcriptome analysis on a large number (N = 136) of zebrafish egg clutches, each clutch being split to monitor developmental success and perform transcriptome analysis in parallel. We aimed at drawing a molecular portrait of the egg in order to characterize the relation between egg transcriptome and developmental success and to subsequently identify new candidate genes involved in fertility.Results:We identified 66 transcript that were differentially abundant in eggs of contrasted phenotype (low or high developmental success). Statistical modeling using partial least squares regression and genetics algorithm demonstrated that gene signatures from transcriptomic data can be used to predict developmental success. The identity and function of differentially expressed genes indicate a major dysregulation of genes of the translational machinery in poor quality eggs. Two genes, otulina and slc29a1a, predominantly expressed in the ovary and dysregulated in poor quality eggs were further investigated using CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome editing. Mutants of each gene revealed remarkable subfertility whereby the majority of their eggs were unfertilizable. The Wnt pathway appeared to be dysregulated in the otulina mutant-derived eggs.Conclusions: Here we show that egg transcriptome contains molecular signatures, which can be used to predict developmental success. Our results also indicate that poor egg quality in zebrafish is associated with a dysregulation of (i) the translational machinery genes and (ii) novel fertility genes, otulina and slc29a1a, playing an important role for fertilization. Together, our observations highlight the diversity of the possible causes of egg quality defects and reveal mechanisms of maternal origin behind the lack of fertilization and early embryonic failures that can occur under normal reproduction conditions.", "title": "What makes a bad egg?

As part of the ARK-XXII/2 Polarstern expedition in summer 2007, Ba was analyzed in the Barents, Kara, Laptev seas, and the Eurasian Basins as well as the Makarov Basin up to the Alpha and Mendeleyev Ridges. By combining salinity, \u03b4 18 O and initial phosphate corrected for mineralization with oxygen (PO 4 *) or N/P ratios we identified the water mass fractions of meteoric water, sea ice meltwater, and marine waters of Atlantic as well as Pacific origin in the upper water column. In all basins inside the lower halocline layer and the Arctic intermediate waters we find Ba concentrations close to those of the Fram Strait branch of the lower halocline (41-45 nM), reflecting the composition of the incoming Atlantic water. A layer of upper halocline water (UHW) with higher Ba concentrations (45-55 nM) is identified in the Makarov Basin. Atop of the UHW, the Surface Mixed Layer (SML), including the summer and winter mixed layers, has high concentrations of Ba (58-67 nM). In the SML of the investigated area of the central Arctic the meteoric fraction can be identified by assuming a conservative behavior of Ba to be primarily of Eurasian river origin. However, in productive coastal regions biological removal compromises the use of Ba to distinguish between Eurasian and NA rivers. As a consequence, the NA river water fraction is underestimated in productive surface waters or waters that have passed a productive region, whereas this fraction is overestimated in subsurface waters containing remineralised Ba, particularly when these waters have passed productive shelf regions. Especially in the Laptev Sea and small regions in the Barents Sea, Ba concentrations are low in surface waters. In the Laptev Sea exceptionally high Ba concentrations in shelf bottom waters indicate that Ba is removed from surface waters to deep waters by biological activity enhanced by increasing ice-free conditions as well as by scavenging by organic matter of terrestrial origin. We interpret high Ba concentrations in the UHW of the Makarov Basin to result from enrichment by remineralisation in bottom waters on the shelf of the Chukchi Sea and therefore the calculated NA runoff is an artefact. We conclude that no NA runoff can be demonstrated unequivocally anywhere during our expedition with the set of tracers considered here. Small contributions of NA runoff may have been masked by Ba depletion and could only be resolved by supportive tracers on the uptake history. We thus suggest that Ba has to be used with care as it can put limits but not yield quantitative water mass distributions. Only if the extra Ba inputs exceed the cumulative biological uptake the signal can be unequivocally attributed to NA runoff.", "title": "Utility of dissolved Barium in distinguishing North American from Eurasian runoff in the Arctic Ocean", "query": "Utility of dissolved Barium in distinguishing North American from Eurasian runoff in the Arctic Ocean"}

But the lower the elevation, the more terraces are affected by turbulent flow erosion. Downward, the channel-floor is a complex area where flows mainly by-pass but locally erode or deposit. The levee is dominantly depositional, but only records high-magnitude events, able to spill over. Low-magnitude, high-frequency events, such as yearly hyperpycnal currents are confined in the upper part of the system and thus have little control on system architecture.

The core, which did not reach the base of the lacustrine sediments, reveals the vegetation and climate history of the last 17 000 years and demonstrates that this area was not glaciated during that time. The Pleistocene/Holocene transition is, as elsewhere in the northern hemisphere, characterized by increased temperatures during the Bolling, Allerod and Preboreal with interruptions during the Older (post-Bolling) and Younger Dryas events. The Holocene climate optimum at Lama Lake probably occurred within the Boreal period, when dense larch forests developed. The Atlantic period was characterized by warm conditions that favoured the establishment of larch-spruce forests, though a climatic deterioration is also recorded. During the Subboreal, spruce fluctuated in importance, on the basis of which it is suggested that there were two cool periods with an intervening warm period. Since 3000 B.P., the climate has become considerably cooler and forests have degenerated.

The analysis was motivated by the surprising short-term salinity trend recorded by a monitoring station deployed in the Atlantic layer of the Strait of Gibraltar between years 2003 and 2007, which has been described and investigated by Millot (2007. Geophys. Res. Lett. 34, L21609. doi:10.1029/2007GL031179.). Temperature and salinity display similar annual cycles whose maxima occur by the end of the year, the former leading the latter by one month approximately. Despite their similarities, their origin is not the same. More than 80% of the variability of the temperature seasonal cycle is accounted for by the annual cycle of surface heat flux, while advective fluxes are secondary. This is not true for salinity, which both seasonal and interannual fluctuations are shaped by the advection and the evaporative annual cycle jointly. For the advection contribution, the identified external agent is the wind stress that drives the upwelling season in the eastern mid-latitude boundary of the North Atlantic. Vertical advection of salinity associated with the Ekman pumping and horizontal advection caused by the upwelling jet and the fluctuations of the North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre are behind the local advective changes. The strengthening (weakening) of the seasonal upwelling in summer (winter) decreased (increased) the local salinity in the Gulf of Cadiz, giving rise to the observed cycle in the data recorded at Gibraltar. Short term trends in the wind-inducing upwelling off the Iberian Peninsula during the above mentioned period triggered concomitant changes of the salinity in the waters that fed the inflow and produced the short\u2013term trend observed in the Strait of Gibraltar.", "title": "On the origin of the seasonal and interannual T-S variability of the inflow through the Strait of Gibraltar", "query": "On the origin of the seasonal and interannual T-S variability of the inflow through the Strait of Gibraltar"}

This assessment includes both existing and future observation platforms. Many important conclusions can be drawn from these studies. It is clear that altimeter data are extremely important for constraining mesoscale variability in ocean forecast systems. The number of altimeters is also important. For example, near-real-time applications need data from four altimeters to achieve skill that is similar to systems using data from two altimeters in delayed mode. Another important result is that sea surface temperature is the only observation parameter that adequately monitors ocean properties in coastal regions and shallow seas. Assimilation of Argo data provides a significant, measurable improvement to GODAE systems, and is the only observation platform that provides global-scale information for constraining salinity.

The survival and distribution of species partly depend on their ability to exploit their physiological plasticity during acclimatization. Therefore, in laboratory studies the effects of simulated future ocean acidification on thermal tolerance, energy metabolism and acid-base regulation capacity of the North Sea population of the blue mussel Mytilus edulis were examined. Following one month of pre-acclimation to 10 \u00b0C and control CO 2 levels, mussels were exposed for two weeks to control and projected oceanic CO 2 levels (390, 750 and 1120 \u03bcatm) before being subjected to a stepwise warming protocol between 10 \u00b0C and 31 \u00b0C (+3 \u00b0C each night). Oxygen consumption and heart rates, anaerobic metabolite levels and haemolymph acidbase status were determined at each temperature. CO 2 exposure left oxygen consumption rate unchanged at acclimation temperature but caused a somewhat stronger increase during acute warming and thus mildly higher Q 10 -values than seen in controls. Interestingly, the thermally induced limitation of oxygen consumption rate set in earlier in normocapnic than in hypercapnic (1120 \u03bcatm CO 2 ) mussels (25.2 \u00b0C vs. 28.8 \u00b0C), likely due to an onset of metabolic depression in the control group following warming. However, the temperature induced increase in heart rate became limited above 25 \u00b0C in both groups indicating an unchanged pejus temperature regardless of CO 2 treatment. An upper critical temperature was reached above 28 \u00b0C in both treatments indicated by the accumulation of anaerobic metabolites in the mantle tissue, paralleled by a strong increase in haemolymph PCO 2 at 31 \u00b0C. Ocean acidification caused a decrease in haemolymph pH. The extracellular acidosis remained largely uncompensated despite some bicarbonate accumulation. In all treatments animals developed a progressive warming-induced extracellular acidosis. A stronger pH drop at around 25 \u00b0C was followed by stagnating heart rates. However, normocapnic mussels enhanced bicarbonate accumulation at the critical limit, a strategy no longer available to hypercapnic mussels. In conclusion, CO 2 has small effects on the response patterns of mussels to warming, leaving thermal thresholds largely unaffected.

Colonial organisms might be particularly resilient to environmental stressors, as organizational modularity and successive asexual generations can allow for distinctively flexible responses in the aggregate form. We performed laboratory experiments to examine the effects of increasing dissolved carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) (i.e. ocean acidification) on the colonial bryozoan Celleporella cornuta sampled from two source populations within a coastal upwelling region of the northern California coast. Bryozoan colonies were remarkably plastic under these CO 2 treatments. Colonies raised under high CO 2 grew more quickly, investing less in reproduction and producing lighter skeletons when compared with genetically identical clones raised under current surface atmosphere CO 2 values. Bryozoans held under high CO 2 conditions also changed the Mg/Ca ratio of skeletal calcite and increased the expression of organic coverings in new growth, which may serve as protection against acidified water. We also observed strong differences between source populations in reproductive investment and organic covering reaction norms, consistent with adaptive responses to persistent spatial variation in local oceanographic conditions. Our results demonstrate that phenotypic plasticity and energetic trade-offs can mediate biological responses to global environmental change, and highlight the broad range of strategies available to colonial organisms.", "title": "Plastic responses of bryozoans to ocean acidification", "query": "Plastic responses of bryozoans to ocean acidification"}

Comparative analysis of several cores along the Chilean continental margin (30\u00b0-41\u00b0S) suggests that the onset and the pattern of deglacial warming was not uniform off central-south Chile due to the progressive southward migration of the Southern Westerlies and local variations in upwelling. Marine productivity augmented rather abruptly at 13-14 ka, well after the oceanographic changes. We suggest that the late deglacial increase in paleoproductivity off central-south Chile reflects the onset of an active upwelling system bringing nutrient-rich, oxygen-poor Equatorial Subsurface Water to the euphotic zone, and a relatively higher nutrient load of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. During the Last Glacial Maximum, when the Southern Westerlies were located further north, productivity off central-south Chile, in contrast to off northern Chile, was reduced due to direct onshore-blowing winds that prevented coastal upwelling and export production.", "title": "Deglacial pattern of circulation and marine productivity in the upwelling region off central-south Chile", "query": "Deglacial pattern of circulation and marine productivity in the upwelling region off central-south Chile"}

Unlike with cars, where we know which fuel the engine requires, we never know in advance what unexpected side effects might be caused by the fuel we feed our models with. Sometimes we increase the fuel's octane number (bias correction) to achieve better performance and find out that the model behaves differently but not always as was expected or desired. This study investigates the impacts of projected climate change on the hydrology of the Upper Blue Nile catchment using two model ensembles consisting of five global CMIP5 Earth system models and 10 regional climate models (CORDEX Africa). WATCH forcing data were used to calibrate an eco-hydrological model and to bias-correct both model ensembles using slightly differing approaches. On the one hand it was found that the bias correction methods considerably improved the performance of average rainfall characteristics in the reference period in most of the cases. This also holds true for non-extreme discharge conditions between Q 20 and Q 80 . On the other hand, biascorrected simulations tend to overemphasize magnitudes of projected change signals and extremes. A general weakness of both uncorrected and bias-corrected simulations is the rather poor representation of high and low flows and their extremes, which were often deteriorated by bias correction. This inaccuracy is a crucial deficiency for regional impact studies dealing with water management issues and it is therefore important to analyse model performance and character-istics and the effect of bias correction, and eventually to exclude some climate models from the ensemble. However, the multi-model means of all ensembles project increasing average annual discharges in the Upper Blue Nile catchment and a shift in seasonal patterns, with decreasing discharges in June and July and increasing discharges from August to November.", "title": "Are we using the right fuel to drive hydrological models?

Although investigating PDAR has the potential to unravel the underlying processes shaping assemblages across spatial scales and to predict PD loss through habitat reduction, it has been little investigated so far. Focusing on PD has noticeable advantages compared to species richness (SR) since PD also gives insights on processes such as speciation/extinction, assembly rules and ecosystem functioning. Here we investigate the universality and pervasiveness of the PDAR at continental scale using terrestrial mammals as study case. We define the relative robustness of PD (compared to SR) to habitat loss as the area between the standardized PDAR and standardized SAR (i.e. standardized by the diversity of the largest spatial window) divided by the area under the standardized SAR only. This metric quantifies the relative increase of PD robustness compared to SR robustness. We show that PD robustness is higher than SR robustness but that it varies among continents. We further use a null model approach to disentangle the relative effect of phylogenetic tree shape and non random spatial distribution of evolutionary history on the PDAR. We find that for most spatial scales and for all continents except Eurasia, PDARs are not different from expected by a model using only the observed SAR and the shape of the phylogenetic tree at continental scale. Interestingly, we detect a strong phylogenetic structure of the Eurasian PDAR that can be predicted by a model that specifically account for a finer biogeographical delineation of this continent. In conclusion, the relative robustness of PD to habitat loss compared to species richness is determined by the phylogenetic tree shape but also depends on the spatial structure of PD.Mazel F.", "title": "Mammalian phylogenetic diversity-area relationships at a continental scale", "query": "Mammalian phylogenetic diversity-area relationships at a continental scale"}

To this end, data obtained by six Pressure Inverted Echo Sounders (PIES) deployed south of Africa were used to derive baroclinic and barotropic SSH anomalies. Our results show that the barotropic component accounts for 30%-60% of the variability between the jets of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). In contrast, the jets associated with the major ACC fronts are predominantly baroclinic. The deep baroclinic component is important in the ACC and accounts for the major part of the baroclinic variability. The comparison with along-track satellite altimetry (Jason 1/2) shows correlations coefficients of 0.24-0.92, with low values in regions of high-barotropic variability. The comparison with gridded Aviso satellite altimetry generally shows higher correlation coefficients (0.33-0.92) and lower root mean square (RMS) errors compared to the along-track product. In conclusion the barotropic SSH anomaly plays a major role in this region and has to be accounted for when assimilating SSH into ocean models. Due to their high-baroclinic component, the correct representation of the time and space varying ACC fronts seems to be crucial for the right SSH anomaly partitioning used for assimilation purposes. Gridded products, namely Aviso, seems to be more suitable compared to alongtrack products (Jason 1/2) in representing the variability of SSH anomalies.", "title": "Barotropic and deep-referenced baroclinic SSH variability derived from Pressure Inverted Echo Sounders (PIES) south of Africa", "query": "Barotropic and deep-referenced baroclinic SSH variability derived from Pressure Inverted Echo Sounders (PIES) south of Africa"}

However, the quality of salinity reanalyses arising from the various ORAs has not yet been comprehensively assessed. In this study, we assess the upper ocean salinity content (depth-averaged over 0-700m) from 14 ORAs and 3 objective ocean analysis systems (OOAs) as part of the Ocean Reanalyses Intercomparison Project (ORA-IP).Our results show that the best agreement between estimates of salinity from different ORAs is obtained in the tropical Pacific, likely due to relatively abundant atmospheric and oceanic observations in this region. The largest disagreement in salinity reanalyses is in the Southern Ocean along the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) as a consequence of the sparseness of both atmospheric and oceanic observations in this region. The West Pacific Warm Pool (WPWP) is the largest region where the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of reanalysed salinity anomalies is greater than 1. Therefore, the current salinity reanalyses in the tropical Pacific Ocean may be more reliable than those in the Southern Ocean and regions along the western boundary currents. Moreover, we found that the assimilation of salinity in ocean regions with relatively strong ocean fronts is still a common problem as seen in most ORAs.The impact of the Argo data on the salinity reanalyses is visible, especially within the upper 500m, where the interannual variability is large. The increasing trend in global-averaged salinity anomalies can only be found within the top 0-300m layer, but with quite large diversity among different ORAs. Beneath the 300m depth, the global-averaged salinity anomalies from most ORAs switch their trends from a slightly growing trend before 2002 to a decreasing trend after 2002. The rapid switch in the trend is most likely an artefact of the dramatic change in the observing system due to the implementation of Argo.", "title": "An assessment of upper ocean salinity content from the Ocean Reanalyses Inter-comparison Project (ORA-IP)", "query": "An assessment of upper ocean salinity content from the Ocean Reanalyses Inter-comparison Project (ORA-IP)"}

We investigated SML thickness and composition in five replicate indoor experiments between September and December 2010. During each experiment, the SML and underlying seawater were sampled from four seawater tanks: one served as control, and three were inoculated with Thalassiosira weissflogii grown in chemostats at 180, 380 and 780 ppm pCO 2 . We examined organic material enrichment factors in each tank, paying particular attention to gel particles accumulation such as polysaccharidic Transparent Exopolymer Particles (TEP) and the proteinaceous Coomassie Stainable Particles (CSP). While previous studies have observed carbohydrates and TEP enrichment in the microlayer, little is yet known about proteinaceous gel particles in the SML. Our experiments show that CSP dominate the gelatinous composition of the SML. We believe that the enrichment in CSP points to the importance of bacterial activity in the microlayer.

A promising mitigation strategy is the identification and breeding of shellfish varieties exhibiting resilience to acidification stress. We experimentally compared the effects of OA on two populations of red abalone (Haliotis rufes- cens), a marine mollusc important to fisheries and global aquacul- ture. Results from our experiments simulating captive aquaculture conditions demonstrated that abalone sourced from a strong up- welling region were tolerant of ongoing OA, whereas a captive- raised population sourced from a region of weaker upwelling exhibited significant mortality and vulnerability to OA. This differ- ence was linked to population-specific variation in the maternal provisioning of lipids to offspring, with a positive correlation be- tween lipid concentrations and survival under OA. This relation- ship also persisted in experiments on second-generation animals, and larval lipid consumption rates varied among paternal crosses, which is consistent with the presence of genetic variation for phys- iological traits relevant for OA survival. Across experimental trials, growth rates differed among family lineages, and the highest mor- tality under OA occurred in the fastest growing crosses. Identify- ing traits that convey resilience to OA is critical to the continued success of abalone and other shellfish production, and these mit- igation efforts should be incorporated into breeding programs for commercial and restoration aquaculture.", "title": "Evolved differences in energy metabolism and growth dictate the impacts of ocean acidification on abalone aquaculture", "query": "Evolved differences in energy metabolism and growth dictate the impacts of ocean acidification on abalone aquaculture"}

The Campeche province consists of numerous 20-40 m-high elongated coral mounds that are developed in intermediate water depths of 500 to 600 m. The mounds are colonized by a vivid cold-water coral ecosystem that covers the upper flanks and summits. The rich coral community is dominated by the framework-building Scleractinia Enallopsammia profunda and Lophelia pertusa, while the associated benthic megafauna shows a rather scarce occurrence. The recent environmental setting is characterized by a high surface water production caused by a local upwelling center and a dynamic bottom-water regime comprising vigorous bottom currents, obvious temporal variability, and strong density contrasts, which all together provide optimal conditions for the growth of cold-water corals. This setting -potentially supported by the diel vertical migration of zooplankton in the Campeche area -controls the delivering of food particles to the corals. The Campeche cold-water coral province is, thus, an excellent example highlighting the importance of the oceanographic setting in securing the food supply for the development of large and vivid cold-water coral ecosystems.", "title": "Environmental forcing of the Campeche cold-water coral province, southern Gulf of Mexico", "query": "Environmental forcing of the Campeche cold-water coral province, southern Gulf of Mexico"}

Here we present the measurements of dissolved NO in the surface and bottom layers at 75 stations in the Bohai Sea (BS) and the Yellow Sea (YS) in June 2011. Moreover, NO photoproduction rates were determined at 27 stations in both seas. The NO concentrations in the surface and bottom layers were highly variable and ranged from below the limit of detection (i.e., 32 pmol L \u22121 ) to 616 pmol L \u22121 in the surface layer and 482 pmol L \u22121 in the bottom layer. There was no significant difference (p>0.05) between the mean NO concentrations in the surface (186 \u00b1 108 pmol L \u22121 ) and bottom (174 \u00b1 123 pmol L \u22121 ) layers. A decreasing trend of NO in bottom-layer concentrations with salinity indicates a NO input by submarine groundwater discharge. NO in the surface layer was supersaturated at all stations during both day and night and therefore the BS and YS were a persistent source of NO to the atmosphere at the time of our measurements. The average flux was about 4.5\u00d710 \u221216 mol cm \u22122 s \u22121 and the flux showed significant positive relationship with the wind speed. The accumulation of NO during daytime was a result of photochemical production, and photoproduction rates were correlated to illuminance. The persistent nighttime NO supersaturation pointed to an unidentified NO dark production. NO sea-to-air flux densities were much lower than the NO photoproduction rates. Therefore, we conclude that the bulk of the NO produced in the mixed layer was rapidly consumed before its release to the atmosphere.", "title": "Nitric oxide (NO) in the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea", "query": "Nitric oxide (NO) in the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea"}

The North Pacific coast of British Columbia is characterized by strong temporal and spatial heterogeneity in ocean conditions with upwelling events elevating CO 2 levels up to 10-fold those of pre-industrial global averages. Early life stages of pink salmon have been shown to be affected by these CO 2 levels, and juveniles naturally migrate through regions of high CO 2 during the energetically costly phase of smoltification. To investigate the physiological response of out-migrating wild juvenile pink salmon to these naturally occurring elevated CO 2 levels, we captured fish in Georgia Strait, British Columbia and transported them to a marine lab (Hakai Institute, Quadra Island) where fish were exposed to one of three CO 2 levels (850, 1500 and 2000 \u03bcatm CO 2 ) for 2 weeks. At 1 / 2 , 1 and 2 weeks of exposure, we measured their weight and length to calculate condition factor (Fulton's K), as well as haematocrit and plasma [Cl \u2212 ]. At each of these times, two additional stressors were imposed (hypoxia and temperature) to provide further insight into their physiological condition. Juvenile pink salmon were largely robust to elevated CO 2 concentrations up to 2000 \u03bcatm CO 2 , with no mortality or change in condition factor over the 2-week exposure duration. After 1 week of exposure, temperature and hypoxia tolerance were significantly reduced in high CO 2 , an effect that did not persist to 2 weeks of exposure. Haematocrit was increased by 20% after 2 weeks in the CO 2 treatments relative to the initial measurements, while plasma [Cl \u2212 ] was not significantly different. Taken together, these data indicate that juvenile pink salmon are quite resilient to naturally occurring high CO 2 levels during their ocean outmigration.", "title": "Physiological resilience of pink salmon to naturally occurring ocean acidification", "query": "Physiological resilience of pink salmon to naturally occurring ocean acidification"}

Plankton blooms had a clear effect on DOM concentration and molecular composition. This succession was reproducible across all 10 mesocosms, independent of CO 2 treatment. In contrast to the temporal trend, there were no significant differences in DOM concentration and composition between present-day and year 2100 CO 2 levels at any time point of the experiment.

We investigated whether OA could affect the larval settlement success of the sea urchin Evechinus chloroticus, a key coastal species with ecological, economic and cultural importance in New Zealand. We performed four settlement experiments to test whether reduced seawater pH (ranging from 8.1 to 7.0, at an interval of ~0.2 pH units) alters larval settlement and metamorphosis success. Our results show that settlement success was not significantly reduced when the larvae were exposed to a range of reduced seawater pH treatments (8.1-7.0) at time of settlement (on direct effects). Similarly, when presented with crustose coralline algae (CCA) pre-conditioned in seawater pH of either pH 8.1 or 7.7 for 28 days, larval settlement success remained unaltered (on indirect effects). We conclude that competent larvae in this species are resilient to OA at time of settlement.

Underwater irradiance, chlorophyll a (Chl a), photochemical efficiency, and primary productivity were measured inside and outside of an iron-enriched patch in order to quantify the response of phytoplankton to iron fertilization. Chl a concentration and photosynthetic rate ( 14 C uptake in simulated in situ incubations) were measured in pico-, nano-, and microphytoplankton. Photochemical efficiency was studied with fast repetition rate fluorometry and xenon-pulse amplitude modulated fluorometry. The high-nutrient low-chlorophyll waters outside the Fe-enriched patch were characterized by deep euphotic zones (63-72 m), low Chl a (48-56 mg m \u03ea2 ), low photosynthetic efficiency (F v /F m \u0d20 0.3), and low daily primary productivity (130-220 mg C m \u03ea2 d \u03ea1 ). Between 70 and 90% of Chl a was found in pico-and nanophytoplankton. During the induced bloom, F v /F m increased up to \u03f30.55, primary productivity and Chl a reached the maximum values of 790 mg C m \u03ea2 d \u03ea1 and 231 mg Chl a m \u03ea2 , respectively. As a consequence, the euphotic depth decreased to \u03f341 m. Picophytoplankton biomass hardly changed. Nano-and microphytoplankton biomass increased. In the first 2 weeks of the experiment, when the depth of the upper mixed layer was mostly \u03fd40 m, primary productivity was highly correlated with Chl a. In the third week, productivity was much lower than predicted from Chl a, probably because of a reduction in photosynthetic capacity as a consequence of increased physical variability in the upper water column.

We report here the occurrence and high abundance of Rhizophora pollen, in association with taraxerol, a Rhizophora-sourced biomarker, from a high-resolution Congo fan core covering the last deglaciation. An age model based on 14 C dates enables the temporal changes in taraxerol content and the percentage frequencies and flux (pollen grains (pg) cm \u00c02 (10 3 yr) \u00c01 ) of mangrove pollen to be compared quantitatively with the lateral rate of transgression across the flooding surface (derived from glacio-hydro-isostatic model output and the bathymetry of the margin). Rhizophora pollen concentrations and taraxerol content of the sediment are very strongly positively correlated with the lateral rate of transgression and indicate, independently of any sequence stratigraphic context, that mangrove pollen spikes are associated with the transgressive systems tract rather than the highstand systems tract or maximum flooding surface. Lower-resolution longer-term records from this margin indicate an association between taraxerol concentrations and transgressive rather than regressive phases. The flux of these materials to the Congo fan is interpreted as a function of the erosion of flooded mangrove swamp on the shelf and, less importantly, changing extent of mangrove habitat, during sea-level rise. Congo River palaeoflood events also result in reworking of mangrove pollen and supply to the fan, but this mechanism is subdominant. Rhizophora pollen has been underestimated in many palynological studies undertaken on cores from the African margin because of inappropriate sieve mesh size used during laboratory preparation.", "title": "High-resolution last deglaciation record from the Congo fan reveals significance of mangrove pollen and biomarkers as indicators of shelf transgression", "query": "High-resolution last deglaciation record from the Congo fan reveals significance of mangrove pollen and biomarkers as indicators of shelf transgression"}

The origin of these variations has been a central topic in evolutionary biology. Up to now, it was commonly accepted that standing genetic variation is the only cause of phenotypic variants. However, epigenetic information is emerging as a complementary source of heritable phenotypic variation that contributes to evolution. The relative importance of genetics and epigenetics in generating heritable phenotypic variation is nevertheless a matter of debate.Results:We used a host-parasite system to address this question. The human blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni can adapt rapidly to new intermediate snail hosts. The interaction between parasite and mollusk is characterized by a compatibility polymorphism illustrating the evolutionary dynamics in this system. The principal molecular marker for compatibility (infection success) is the expression pattern of a group of polymorphic mucins (SmPoMuc) in the parasite. We show here that chromatin structure changes as the SmPoMuc promoters are the cause for SmPoMuc transcription polymorphism leading to phenotypic novelty and increase in infection success, i.e., fitness.Conclusion:We establish that epigenetic changes can be the major if not only cause of adaptive phenotypic variants in Schistosoma mansoni, suggesting that epimutations can provide material for adaptive evolution in the absence of genetic variation in other systems. In addition, our results indicate that epidrugs can be used to control parasite development but also parasite evolution.", "title": "Epigenetic origin of adaptive phenotypic variants in the human blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni", "query": "Epigenetic origin of adaptive phenotypic variants in the human blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni"}

The physiological mechanisms used by oysters to cope with salinity stress are energy demanding and may impair other processes, such as defense against pathogens. This oyster species has been experiencing recurrent mortality events caused by the Ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1). The objectives of this study were to investigate the effect of salinity (10, 15, 25 and 35\u2030) on energetic reserves, key enzyme activities and membrane fatty acids, and to identify the metabolic risk factors related to OsHV-1-induced mortality of oysters. Acclimation to low salinity led to increased water content, protein level, and energetic reserves (carbohydrates and triglycerides) of oysters. The latter was consistent with lower activity of hexokinase, the first enzyme involved in glycolysis, up-regulation of AMP-activated protein kinase, a major regulator of cellular energy metabolism, and lower activity of catalase, an antioxidant enzyme involved in management of reactive oxygen species. Acclimation to salinity also involved a major remodeling of membrane fatty acids. Particularly, 20:4n-6 decreased linearly with decreasing salinity, likely reflecting its mobilization for prostaglandin synthesis in oysters. The survival of oysters exposed to OsHV-1 varied from 43% to 96% according to salinity (Fuhrmann et al., 2016). Risk analyses showed that activity of superoxide dismutase and levels of proteins, carbohydrates, and triglycerides were associated with a reduced risk of death.

Methane concentrations and stable carbon isotopic ratios varied between 2 and 240 nM, and between \u00c053% and \u00c020% VPDB, respectively. Methane in high concentrations was depleted in 13 C whereas in low concentrations d 13 C CH 4 values were highly variable.On the continental shelf we found that methane discharged from seeps on top of sandy and gravelly banks is isotopically heavier than methane escaping from troughs filled with silty and clayey sediments. These distinct isotopic signatures suggest that methane is gently released from several inter-granular seepages or micro-seepages widely spread over the shelf. A potential migration path for thermogenic or hydrate methane may be the Hornsund Fracture Zone, a south-north running reactivated fault system created by stretching of the continental crust.After discharge into the water column, local water currents fed by Atlantic water, coastal water, and freshwater outflows from the fjords further determine pathways and fate of the methane. We used d 18 O water and 222 Rn data to trace origin and advection of the local water masses and water mixing processes. Methane spreads predominantly along pycnoclines and by vertical mixing. During transport methane is influenced simultaneously by oxidation and dilution, as well as loss into the atmosphere.

There are many interrelated processes involved in ice-wedge thermokarst and it is a major challenge to quantify their influence on the stability of the permafrost underlying the landscape. In this study we used a numerical modelling approach to investigate the degradation of ice wedges with a focus on the influence of hydrological conditions. Our study area was Samoylov Island in the Lena River delta of northern Siberia, for which we had in situ measurements to evaluate the model. The tailored version of the CryoGrid 3 land surface model was capable of simulating the changing microtopography of polygonal tundra and also regarded lateral fluxes of heat, water, and snow. We demonstrated that the approach is capable of simulating ice-wedge degradation and the associated transition from a low-centred to a highcentred polygonal microtopography. The model simulations showed ice-wedge degradation under recent climatic conditions of the study area, irrespective of hydrological conditions. However, we found that wetter conditions lead to an earlier onset of degradation and cause more rapid ground subsidence. We set our findings in correspondence to observed types of ice-wedge polygons in the study area and hypothesized on remaining discrepancies between modelled and observed ice-wedge thermokarst activity. Our quantitative approach provides a valuable complement to previous, more qualitative and conceptual, descriptions of the possible pathways of ice-wedge polygon evolution.

However, the behavior of Mo during early diagenesis is still not fully understood, which complicates the application of the Mo proxy in ancient continental margin environments. Here, we present Mo concentrations and isotope compositions of sediment and pore water samples from the Guaymas Basin in the Gulf of California. Our sample set covers a broad range of depositional environments, including sediments from within the eastern equatorial Pacific oxygen minimum zone (OMZ), from a semi-restricted oxic graben, and from near a hydrothermal vent-field. By investigating Mo cycling in these different settings, we provide new insights into different modes of Mo fixation and the associated isotope fractionation. Sediments from the OMZ have authigenic Mo concentrations (Moauth) between 3.3 and 17.2 \u00b5g/g and \u03b498Mo between +1.64 and +2.13\u2030. A linear decrease in pore water Mo concentrations to the depth where hydrogen sulfide accumulates, along with sedimentary authigenic \u03b498Mo values (\u03b498Moauth) close to seawater, indicate diffusion of Mo from the bottom water into the sediment with little isotope fractionation during quantitative Mo removal.

Pore water Mo concentrations are generally higher than ambient bottom water concentrations and the light \u03b498Mo signatures of the pore waters between +0.50 and +0.80\u2030 and \u03b498Moauth signatures of the sediments indicate continuous Mo exchange between the pore water and Mn and Fe oxides during early diagenesis. Sediment samples from the vent field mainly consist of black smoker debris and are characterized by Moauth concentrations ranging from 8.6 to 33.2 \u00b5g/g and \u03b498Moauth values as high as +2.20\u2030. The relatively high Mo concentrations and seawater-like \u03b498Mo can be explained by near-quantitative Mo scavenging from hydrothermal solutions with little isotope fractionation at high temperatures. Comparison of our new data for the OMZ sediments in the Gulf of California with previously published data for sediments from the Peruvian OMZ highlights that Mo isotope compositions in this kind of setting strongly depend on how Mo is delivered to the sediment. If diffusive Mo delivery from the bottom water into the sediment significantly contributes to Mo accumulation in the solid phase, as is the case in the Guaymas Basin, sedimentary Moauth concentrations are relatively low but the isotope values are close to the \u03b498Mo signal of seawater. If Mo is exclusively delivered by particles, like on the Peruvian shelf, much higher sedimentary Moauth concentrations can be attained. In the latter case, Moauth isotope values will be lighter because the sediments preserve the isotopic offset that was generated during adsorption or uptake of Mo by particles. Our findings de-emphasize the role of dissolved Mo speciation in pore waters but highlight the importance of the mode of Mo delivery for the Mo concentration and isotope composition preserved in the paleo-record.", "title": "Influence of particulate versus diffusive molybdenum supply mechanisms on the molybdenum isotope composition of continental margin sediments", "query": "Influence of particulate versus diffusive molybdenum supply mechanisms on the molybdenum isotope composition of continental margin sediments"}

Monthly samplings were conducted from February/2009 to January/2011, with 617 individuals analyzed, being 365 females and 262 males. A similar form of distribution in length and weight between the sexes was observed. There was no significant variation in sex ratio over time, with higher proportion of females during the entire sampled period. Both sexes presented a angular coefficient of Weight/Length (b) relationship greater than 3, with speed of increase in weight greater than in length. For females, a long reproductive period was observed, with greater reproductive intensity from January through June. No significant correlation was observed between the Gonadosomatic Index (GSI) and the average temperature, rainfall and river level, despite the fact that reproductive activity occurs in autumn/winter, when there are favorable conditions due to flooding. The size at first maturation (L 50 ) was 20.2 mm, with confidence interval varying from 19.7 through 20.7 mm. The average fecundity was 191.9 oocytes/females and was significantly related to the standard length and total weight (g), demonstrating a relation with energy accumulation to invest in reproduction. The long reproductive period, intensified by partial spawning, higher proportion of females and low L 50 , show that the species has strategies necessary for survival and rapid population growth, common in small species characterized as r-strategists.", "title": "Reproductive biology of Hyphessobrycon eques (Characiformes: Characidae) in Southern Pantanal, Brazil", "query": "Reproductive biology of Hyphessobrycon eques (Characiformes: Characidae) in Southern Pantanal, Brazil"}

To test the hypothesis that riparian forest buffers can reduce the impacts of deforestation on tropical stream biota, we sampled fish assemblages in lowland headwater streams in southeastern Costa Rica representing three different treatments:(1) forested reference stream reaches, (2) stream reaches adjacent to pasture with a riparian forest buffer averaging at least 15 m in width on each bank, and (3) stream reaches adjacent to pasture without a riparian forest buffer. Land cover upstream from the study reaches was dominated by forest at all of the sites, allowing us to isolate the reach-scale effects of the three study treatments. Fish density was significantly higher in pasture reaches than in forest and forest buffer reaches, mostly due to an increase in herbivore-detritivores, but fish biomass did not differ among reach types. Fish species richness was also higher in pasture reaches than in forested reference reaches, while forest buffer reaches were intermediate. Overall, the taxonomic and trophic structure of fish assemblages in forest and forest buffer reaches was very similar, while assemblages in pasture reaches were quite distinct. These patterns were persistent across three sampling periods during our 15-month study. Differences in stream ecosystem conditions between pasture reaches and forested sites, including higher stream temperatures, reduced fruit and seed inputs, and a trend toward increased periphyton abundance, appeared to favor fish species normally found in larger streams and facilitate a native invasion process. Forest buffer reaches, in contrast, had stream temperatures and allochthonous inputs more similar to forested streams.

The occurrence of mesoscale eddies that develop suboxic environments at shallow depth (about 40\u2013100m) has recently been reported for the eastern tropical North Atlantic (ETNA). Their hydrographic structure suggests that the water mass inside the eddy is well isolated from ambient waters supporting the development of severe near-surface oxygen deficits. So far, hydrographic and biogeochemical characterization of these eddies was limited to a few autonomous surveys, with the use of moorings, underwater gliders and profiling floats. In this study we present results from the first dedicated biogeochemical survey of one of these eddies conducted in March 2014 near the Cape Verde Ocean Observatory (CVOO). During the survey the eddy core showed oxygen concentrations as low as 5\u00b5molkg\u22121 with a pH of around 7.6 at approximately 100m depth. Correspondingly, the aragonite saturation level dropped to 1 at the same depth, thereby creating unfavorable conditions for calcifying organisms. To our knowledge, such enhanced acidity within near-surface waters has never been reported before for the open Atlantic Ocean. Vertical distributions of particulate organic matter and dissolved organic matter (POM and DOM), generally showed elevated concentrations in the surface mixed layer (0\u201370m), with DOM also accumulating beneath the oxygen minimum. With the use of reference data from the upwelling region where these eddies are formed, the oxygen utilization rate was calculated by determining oxygen consumption through the remineralization of organic matter. Inside the core, we found these rates were almost 1 order of magnitude higher (apparent oxygen utilization rate (aOUR); 0.26\u00b5molkg\u22121day\u22121) than typical values for the open North Atlantic. Computed downward fluxes for particulate organic carbon (POC), were around 0.19 to 0.23g Cm\u22122day\u22121 at 100m depth, clearly exceeding fluxes typical for an oligotrophic open-ocean setting. The observations support the view that the oxygen-depleted eddies can be viewed as isolated, westwards propagating upwelling systems of their own, thereby represent re-occurring alien biogeochemical environments in the ETNA.", "title": "Oxygen utilization and downward carbon flux in an oxygen-depleted eddy in the eastern tropical North Atlantic", "query": "Oxygen utilization and downward carbon flux in an oxygen-depleted eddy in the eastern tropical North Atlantic"}

Ninety-eight names of Octocorallia were found to be given in the economic exclusive zone of the Azores. While 25 names were changed or added to the known Azorean octocoral diversity, 3 species identified in the region and unreported in the reviewed literature, increase the number to 101 species. Twenty-five names were synonymized while three species names were unmasked as errors in need of taxonomical clarification.

With its large heat and carbon capacity and relatively slow dynamics, the ocean plays an integral role in climate, and provides an important source of predictability at seasonal and longer timescales. In addition, the ocean provides the slowly evolving lower boundary to the atmosphere, driving, and modifying atmospheric weather. Understanding and monitoring ocean climate variability and change, to constrain and initialize models as well as identify model biases for improved climate hindcasting and prediction, requires a scale-sensitive, and long-term observing system. A climate observing system has requirements that significantly differ from, and sometimes are orthogonal to, those of other applications. In general terms, they can be summarized by the simultaneous need for both large spatial and long temporal coverage, and by the accuracy and stability required for detecting the local climate signals.

It considers global as well as regional aspects that should be accounted for in designing observing systems in individual basins. Furthermore, the paper discusses which data-driven products are required to meet WCRP research and modeling needs, and ways to obtain them through data synthesis and assimilation approaches.

Using a metabarcoding dataset of marine plankton from the global ocean, 318 054 mixotrophic metabarcodes represented by 89 951 866 sequences and belonging to 133 taxonomic lineages were identified and classified into four mixotrophic functional types: constitutive mixotrophs (CM), generalist non-constitutive mixotrophs (GNCM), endosymbiotic specialist non-constitutive mixotrophs (eSNCM) and plastidic specialist non-constitutive mixotrophs (pSNCM). Mixotrophy appeared ubiquitous, and the distributions of the four mixotypes were analyzed to identify the abiotic factors shaping their biogeographies. Kleptoplastidic mixotrophs (GNCM & pSNCM) were detected in new zones compared to previous morphological studies.Constitutive and non-constitutive mixotrophs had similar ranges of distributions.Most lineages were evenly found in the samples, yet some of them displayed strongly contrasted distributions, both across and within mixotypes. Particularly divergent biogeographies were found within endo-symbiotic mixotrophs, depending on the ability to form colonies or the mode of symbiosis. We showed how metabarcoding can be used in a complementary way with previous morphological observations to study the biogeography of mixotrophic protists and 3 to identify key drivers of their biogeography.", "title": "Mixotrophic protists display contrasted biogeographies in the global ocean", "query": "Mixotrophic protists display contrasted biogeographies in the global ocean"}

Particulate mass, carbon (organic and inorganic) (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) export fluxes were measured at the equator in the western and central Pacific during two 67 day-long time-series stations located in the warm pool (TS-I at 0\u201d, 167\u201dE) and in the equatorial HNLC situation (TS-II at O\u201d, 15O\u201dW), using drifting sediment traps deployed for 48 h at four depths (between, approximately, 100 and 300 m). The particulate organic carbon (POC) fluxes at the base of the euphotic zone (0. I % light level), were approximately four times lower at TS-I than at TS-II (4.1 VS. 17.0 mmol C me2 day-\u2018). Conversely, fluxes measured at 300 m were similar at both sites (3.6 vs. 3.7 mmol C m-\u2019 day-\u2019 at TS-I and TS-II, respectively). This change in export fluxes was in good agreement with food-web dynamics in the euphotic zone characterized by an increase in plankton biomasses and metabolic rates and a shift towards larger size from TS-I to TS-II. The POC flux profiles indicated high remineralization (up to 78%) of the exported particles at TS-II, between 100 and 200 m in the Equatorial Undercurrent. According to zooplankton ingestion estimates from 100-300 m, 60% of this POC loss could be accounted for by zooplankton grazing. At TS-I, no marked increase of flux with depth was observed, and we assume that loss of particles was compensated by in-situ particle production by zooplankton. Fluxes of particulate nitrogen and phosphorus followed the same general patterns as the POC fluxes. The elemental and pigment composition of the exported particles was not very different between the two stations. In particular, the POC:PN flux molar ratio at the base of the euphotic zone was low, 6.9 and 6.2 at TS-I and TS-II, respectively. For particulate inorganic carbon (mainly carbonate) flux, values at the base of the euphotic zone averaged 0.9 mmol C me2 day-\u2019 at TS-I and 2.3 mmol Cm-2 day- \u2019 at TS-II (corresponding to a 2.6-fold increase) and showed low depth changes at both stations. POC export flux (including active flux associated with the interzonal migrants) at the 0.1% light level depth represented only 8% of primary production (i4C uptake) measured at TS-I and 19% at TS-II. For the time and space scales considered in the present study, new primary production, as measured by the \u201cN method, was in good agreement with the total export flux in the HNLC situation, thus leading to negligible dissolved organic carbon (DOC) or nitrogen (DON) losses from the photic zone. Conversely, export flux was found to be only 50% (C units) and 60% (N) of new production in the oligotrophic system, either because of an overestimation by the 15N method or of a significant export of DOC and DON. Comparison with other oceanic regions shows that export flux in the warm pool was within the same range as in the central gyres. On the other hand, comparison with EqPac data in the central Pacific suggests that there is no straightforward relation between the magnitude of the export and surface nitrate concentrations. 0 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

While diverse physiological and ecological effects have been identified, changes in those molecular mechanisms, which shape the physiological phenotype of a species and limit its capacity to compensate, remain poorly understood. Here, we use global gene expression profiling through RNA-Sequencing to study the transcriptional responses to ocean acidification and warming in gills of the boreal spider crab Hyas araneus exposed medium-term (10 weeks) to intermediate (1,120 \u03bcatm) and high (1,960 \u03bcatm) PCO 2 at different temperatures (5\u00b0C and 10\u00b0C).Results:The analyses reveal shifts in steady state gene expression from control to intermediate and from intermediate to high CO 2 exposures. At 5\u00b0C acid-base, energy metabolism and stress response related genes were upregulated at intermediate PCO 2 , whereas high PCO 2 induced a relative reduction in expression to levels closer to controls. A similar pattern was found at elevated temperature (10\u00b0C). There was a strong coordination between acid-base, metabolic and stress-related processes. Hemolymph parameters at intermediate PCO 2 indicate enhanced capacity in acid-base compensation potentially supported by upregulation of a V-ATPase. The likely enhanced energy demand might be met by the upregulation of the electron transport system (ETS), but may lead to increased oxidative stress reflected in upregulated antioxidant defense transcripts. These mechanisms were attenuated by high PCO 2 , possibly as a result of limited acid-base compensation and metabolic down-regulation.Conclusion:Our findings indicate a PCO 2 dependent threshold beyond which compensation by acclimation fails progressively. They also indicate a limited ability of this stenoecious crustacean to compensate for the effects of ocean acidification with and without concomitant warming.", "title": "Gene expression profiling in gills of the great spider crab Hyas araneus in response to ocean acidification and warming", "query": "Gene expression profiling in gills of the great spider crab Hyas araneus in response to ocean acidification and warming"}

Although the scientific community have amassed 70 000 surface fugacities of carbon dioxide (f CO 2 ) data points within the ETPO region over the past 25 years, the spatial and temporal resolution of this data set is insufficient to fully quantify the seasonal to interannual variability of the region, a region where f CO 2 has been observed to fluctuate by > 300 \u00b5atm.Upwelling and rainfall events dominate the surface physical and chemical characteristics of the ETPO, with both yielding unique signatures in sea surface temperature and salinity. Thus, we explore the potential of using a statistical description of f CO 2 within sea-surface salinity-temperature space. These SSS/SST relationships are based on in situ surface ocean CO 2 atlas (SOCAT) data collected within the ETPO. This statistical description is then applied to highresolution (0.25 \u2022 ) Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) sea surface salinity (SSS) and Operational Sea Surface Temperature and Sea Ice Analysis (OSTIA) sea surface temperature (SST) in order to compute regional f CO 2 . As a result, we are able to resolve f CO 2 at sufficiently high resolution to elucidate the influence that various physical processes have on the f CO 2 of the surface ETPO.Normalised (to 2014) oceanic f CO 2 between July 2010 and June 2014 within the entire ETPO was 39 (\u00b110.7) \u00b5atm supersaturated with respect to 2014 atmospheric partial pressures, and featured a CO 2 outgassing of 1.51 (\u00b10.41) mmol m \u22122 d \u22121 . Values of f CO 2 within the ETPO were found to be broadly split between the Gulf of Panama region and the rest of the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean. The northwest, central and offshore regions were supersaturated, with wintertime wind-jet-driven upwelling found to constitute the first-order control on f CO 2 values. This contrasts with the southeastern/Gulf of Panama region, where heavy rainfall combined with rapid stratification of the upper water column act to dilute dissolved inorganic carbon, and yield f CO 2 values undersaturated with respect to atmospheric fugacities of CO 2 .", "title": "New insights into fCO2 variability in the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean using SMOS SSS", "query": "New insights into fCO2 variability in the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean using SMOS SSS"}

Our analyses showed that non-native species increased significantly in tropical and temperate regulated rivers, but not in boreal rivers.

Such changes in fish assemblages may affect food web stability and merit closer study. Across the literature examined, predominant mechanisms that render fish assemblages susceptible to impacts from dams were: (1) the transformation of the lotic environment into a lentic environment; (2) habitat fragmentation and (3) the introduction of non-native species.

Reducing the un- certainties in climate change modeling requires a better un- derstanding of the aerosol optical properties, and for this we need accurate data on the aerosol refractive index (RI). Due to the remoteness of Antarctica only very few RI data are available from this region (Hogan et al., 1979; Virkkula et al., 2006; Shepherd et al., 2018). We calculate the real refractive index of natural atmospheric aerosols from number size dis- tribution measurements at the German coastal Antarctic sta- tion Neumayer III. Given the high average scattering albedo of 0.992 (Weller et al., 2013), we assumed that the imagi- nary part of the RI is zero. Our method uses the overlapping size range (particle diameter D between 120 and 340 nm) of a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS), which sizes the particles by their electrical mobility, and a laser aerosol spectrometer (LAS), which sizes the particles by their optical scattering signal at the 633 nm wavelength. Based on almost a complete year of measurement, the av- erage effective refractive index (RIeff, as we call our retrieved RI because of the used assumptions) for the dry aerosol par- ticles turned out to be 1.44 with a standard deviation of 0.08, in a good agreement with the RI value of 1.47, which we derived from the chemical composition of bulk aerosol sampling measurements. At Neumayer the aerosol shows a pronounced seasonal pattern in both number concentration and chemical composition. Despite this, the variability of the monthly averaged RIeff values remained between 1.40 and 1.50. Compared to the annual mean, two austral win- ter months (July and September) showed slightly but signif- icantly increased values (1.50 and 1.47, respectively). The size dependency of the RIeff could be determined from time- averaged LAS and SMPS number size distributions mea- sured between December 2017 and January 2018. Here we calculated RIeff for four different particle size ranges and ob- served a slight decrease from 1.47 (D range 116\u2013168 nm) to 1.37 (D range 346\u2013478 nm). We \ufb01nd no signi\ufb01cant dependence of the derived RIeff val- ues on the wind direction. Thus we conclude that RIeff is largely independent of the general weather situation, roughly classi\ufb01ed as (i) advection of marine boundary layer air masses during easterly winds caused by passing cyclones in contrast to (ii) air mass transport from continental Antarc- tica under southern katabatic winds. Neumayer, the only rel- evant contamination source, is located 1.5 km north of the air chemistry observatory, where the measurements were per- formed. Given that northerly winds are almost absent, the potential impact of local contamination is minimized in gen- eral. Indeed our data show no impact of local contamination on RIeff. Just in one case a temporary high-contamination episode with diesel engines operating right next to the mea- surement site resulted in an unusual high RIeff of 1.59, prob- ably caused by the high black carbon content of the exhaust fumes. To conclude, our study revealed largely constant RIeff values throughout the year without any sign of seasonal- ity. Therefore, it seems reasonable to use a single, constant RIeff value of 1.44 for modeling optical properties of natural, coastal Antarctic sub-micrometer aerosol.", "title": "One year of aerosol refractive index measurement from a coastal Antarctic site", "query": "One year of aerosol refractive index measurement from a coastal Antarctic site"}

Mineralization increased as a consequence of high CO 2 in the cartilage of crura and jaws, while temperature decreased mineralization in the pectoral fins. Mineralization affects stiffness and strength of skeletal elements linearly, with implications for feeding and locomotion performance and efficiency.

Our results indicate that three of Palmyra's most abundant large predators (e.g., two reef sharks and one snapper) use resources from different habitats creating important linkages across ecosystems. Observations of cross-system foraging such as this have important implications for the understanding of ecosystem functioning, the management of large-predator populations, and the design of conservation measures intended to protect whole ecosystems.

Here we present an 18 ka extension of the time scale such that GICC05 continuously covers the past 60 ka. The new section of the time scale places the onset of Greenland Interstadial 12 (GI-12) at 46.9\u00b11.0 ka b2k (before year AD 2000), the North Atlantic Ash Zone II layer in GI-15 at 55.4\u00b11.2 ka b2k, and the onset of GI-17 at 59.4\u00b11.3 ka b2k. The error estimates are derived from the accumulated number of uncertain annual layers. In the 40-60 ka interval, the new time scale has a discrepancy with the Meese-Sowers GISP2 time scale of up to 2.4 ka. Assuming that the Greenland climatic events are synchronous with those seen in the Chinese Hulu Cave speleothem record, GICC05 compares well to the time scale of that record with absolute age differences of less than 800 years throughout the 60 ka period. The new time scale is generally in close agreement with other independently dated records and reference horizons, such as the Laschamp geomagnetic excursion, the French Villars Cave and the Austrian Kleegruben Cave speleothem records, suggesting high accuracy of both event durations and absolute age estimates.", "title": "A 60 000 year Greenland stratigraphic ice core chronology", "query": "A 60 000 year Greenland stratigraphic ice core chronology"}

Eolian mineral dust represents one of the main Fe sources to the oceans; thus, quantifying its variability over the last glacial cycle is crucial to evaluate its role in strengthening the biological carbon pump. Polar ice cores, which preserve detailed climate records in their stratigraphy, provide a sensitive and continuous archive for reconstructing past eolian Fe fluxes. Here, we show the Northern Hemisphere Fe record retrieved from the NEEM ice core (Greenland), which offers a unique opportunity to reconstruct the past Fe fluxes in a portion of the Arctic over the last 108 kyr. Holocene Fe fluxes (0.042-11.7 ka, 0.5 mg m \u22122 yr \u22121 ) at the NEEM site were 4 times lower than the average recorded over the last glacial period (11.7-108 ka, 2.0 mg m \u22122 yr \u22121 ), whereas they were greater during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 14.5-26.5 ka, 3.6 mg m \u22122 yr \u22121 ) and Marine Isotope Stage 4 (MIS 4; 60-71 ka, 5.8 mg m \u22122 yr \u22121 ). Comparing the NEEM Fe record with paleoceanographic records retrieved from the HNLC North Pacific, we found that the coldest periods, characterized by the highest Fe fluxes, were distinguished by low marine primary productivity in the subarctic Pacific Ocean, likely due to the greater sea ice extent and the absence of major nutrients upwelling. This supports the hypothesis that Fe fertilization during colder and dustier periods (i.e., LGM and MIS 4) was more effective in other regions, such as the midlatitude North Pacific, where a closer relationship between marine productivity and the NEEM Fe fluxes was observed.", "title": "Atmospheric iron supply and marine productivity in the glacial North Pacific Ocean", "query": "Atmospheric iron supply and marine productivity in the glacial North Pacific Ocean"}

The influence of the acquisition parameters was quantified. Seismic data processing dedicated to SO was also investigated. Conventional seismic acquisition systems were found to be ill-suited to the imaging of shallow oceanographic structures, because of a high antenna filter effect induced by large offsets and seismic trace lengths, and sources that typically cannot provide both a high level of emission and fine vertical resolution. We considered a test case, the imagery of the seasonal thermocline on the western Brittany continental shelf.

Antarctic sea ice is covered with snow during most of the year. The snow contributes substantially to the sea-ice mass budget as the heavy snow loads can depress the ice below water level causing flooding. Refreezing of the snow and seawater mixture results in snow-ice formation on the ice surface. The snow cover determines also the amount of light being reflected, absorbed, and transmitted into the upper ocean, determining the surface energy budget of ice-covered oceans. The amount of light penetrating through sea ice into the upper ocean is of critical importance for the timing and amount of bottom sea-ice melt, biogeochemical processes and under-ice ecosystems. Here, we present results of several recent observations in the Weddell Sea measuring solar radiation under Antarctic sea ice with instrumented Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV). The combination of under-ice optical measurements with simultaneous characterization of surface properties, such as sea-ice thickness and snow depth, allows the identification of key processes controlling the spatial distribution of the under-ice light. Thus, our results show how the distinction between flooded and non-flooded sea-ice regimes dominates the spatial scales of under-ice light variability for areas smaller than 100m-by-100m. In contrast, the variability on larger scales seems to be controlled by the floe-size distribution and the associated lateral incidence of light. These results are related to recent studies on the spatial variability of Arctic under-ice light fields focusing on the distinctly differing dominant surface properties between the northern (e.g. summer melt ponds) and southern (e.g. year-round snow cover, surface flooding) hemisphere sea-ice cover.", "title": "Influence of snow depth and surface flooding on light transmission through Antarctic pack ice", "query": "Influence of snow depth and surface flooding on light transmission through Antarctic pack ice"}

However, our data suggest that marine productivity can only explain a fraction of atmospheric CO 2 changes (up to around 40-50 ppmv), occurring at glacial maxima in each glacial stage. In this sense, the good correlation of our SST record to the EDC temperature reconstruction suggests that the initial glacial CO 2 decrease, as well as the change in the amplitude of the CO 2 cycles observed around 400 ka, was most likely driven by physical processes, possibly related to changes in Antarctic sea ice extent, surface water stratification, and westerly winds position.", "title": "Links between iron supply, marine productivity, sea surface temperature, and CO2over the last 1.1 Ma", "query": "Links between iron supply, marine productivity, sea surface temperature, and CO2over the last 1.1 Ma"}

Only a few studies have addressed the impact of ocean acidification on shell microstructure and geochemistry. In this study, a detailed microstructure and stable isotope geochemistry investigation was performed on nine adult brachiopod specimens of Magellania venosa (Dixon, 1789). These were grown in the natural environment as well as in controlled culturing experiments under different pH conditions (ranging from 7.35 to 8.15 \u00b1 0.05) over different time intervals (214 to 335 days). Details of shell microstructural features, such as thickness of the primary layer, density and size of endopunctae and morphology of the basic structural unit of the secondary layer were analysed using scanning electron microscopy. Stable isotope compositions (\u03b4 13 C and \u03b4 18 O) were tested from the secondary shell layer along shell ontogenetic increments in both dorsal and ventral valves.

Previous studies have identified considerable population genetic structure for Atlantic cod. However, within Norway, which is the country with the largest remaining catch in the Atlantic, the population genetic structure of coastal cod (NCC) along the entire coastline has not yet been investigated. We sampled > 4000 cod from 55 spawning sites. All fish were genotyped with 6 microsatellite markers and Pan I (Dataset 1). A sub-set of the samples (1295 fish from 17 locations) were also genotyped with an additional 9 microsatellites (Dataset 2). Otoliths were read in order to exclude North East Arctic Cod (NEAC) from the analyses, as and where appropriate.Results: We found no difference in genetic diversity, measured as number of alleles, allelic richness, heterozygosity nor effective population sizes, in the north-south gradient. In both data sets, weak but significant population genetic structure was revealed (Dataset 1: global F ST = 0.008, P < 0.0001. Dataset 2: global F ST = 0.004, P < 0.0001). While no clear genetic groups were identified, genetic differentiation increased among geographically-distinct samples. Although the locus Gmo132 was identified as a candidate for positive selection, possibly through linkage with a genomic region under selection, overall trends remained when this locus was excluded from the analyses. The most common allele in loci Gmo132 and Gmo34 showed a marked frequency change in the north-south gradient, increasing towards the frequency observed in NEAC in the north.Conclusion:We conclude that Norwegian coastal cod displays significant population genetic structure throughout its entire range, that follows a trend of isolation by distance. Furthermore, we suggest that a gradient of genetic introgression between NEAC and NCC contributes to the observed population genetic structure. The current management regime for coastal cod in Norway, dividing it into two stocks at 62\u00b0N, represents a simplification of the level of genetic connectivity among coastal cod in Norway, and needs revision.", "title": "Analysis of coastal cod (Gadus morhua L.) sampled on spawning sites reveals a genetic gradient throughout Norway\u2019s coastline", "query": "Analysis of coastal cod (Gadus morhua L.) sampled on spawning sites reveals a genetic gradient throughout Norway\u2019s coastline"}

Here, we estimated the individual FCR of 588 sea bass using individual rearing under restricted feeding. These fish were also phenotyped for their weight loss at fasting and muscle fat content that were possibly linked to FCR. The 588 fish were derived from a full factorial mating between parental lines divergently selected for high (F+) or low (F-) weight loss at fasting. The pedigree was known back to the great grand-parents. A subset of 400 offspring and their ancestors were genotyped for 1,110 SNPs which allowed to calculate the genomic heritability of traits. Individual FCR and growth rate in aquarium were both heritable (genomic h\u00b2 = 0.47 and 0.76, respectively) and strongly genetically correlated (\u22120.98) meaning that, under restricted feeding, faster growing fish were more efficient. FCR and growth rate in aquariums were also significantly better for fish with both parents from F-(1.38), worse for fish with two parents F+ (1.51) and intermediate for cross breed fish (F+/F-or F-/F+ at 1.46). Muscle fat content was positively genetically correlated to growth rate in aquarium and during fasting. Thus, selecting for higher growth rate in aquarium, lower weight loss during fasting and fatter fish could improve FCR in aquarium. Improving these traits would also improve FCR of fish in normal group rearing conditions, as we showed experimentally that groups composed of fish with good individual FCR were significantly more efficient. The FCR of groups was also better when the fish composing the groups had, on average, lower estimated breeding values for growth rate during fasting (losing less weight). Thus, improving FCR in aquarium and weight loss during fasting is promising to improve FCR of fish in groups but a selection response experiment needs to be done. Finally, we showed that the reliability of estimated breeding values was higher (from +10% up to +125%) with a genomic-based BLUP model than with a traditional pedigree-based BLUP, showing that genomic data would enhance the accuracy of the prediction of EBV of selection candidates.", "title": "Combining Individual Phenotypes of Feed Intake With Genomic Data to Improve Feed Efficiency in Sea Bass", "query": "Combining Individual Phenotypes of Feed Intake With Genomic Data to Improve Feed Efficiency in Sea Bass"}

We measured oxygen consumption, dry weight, developmental time and mortality in zoea I to assess changes in performance. Feeding rates and survival under starvation were investigated at different temperatures to detect differences in thermal sensitivities of zoea I and zoea II larvae depending on pre-hatch history. When embryos were preexposed to elevated pCO 2 during maternal care, mortality increased about 60% under continued CO 2 exposure during the zoea I phase. The larvae that moulted into zoea II displayed a developmental delay by about 20 d compared to larvae exposed to control pCO 2 during embryonic and zoeal phases. Elevated pCO 2 caused a reduction in zoea I dry weight and feeding rates, while survival of the starved larvae was not affected by seawater CO 2 concentration. In conclusion, CO 2 effects on egg masses under maternal care carried over to the first larval stages of crustaceans and reduced their survival and development to levels below those previously reported in studies exclusively focussing on acute pCO 2 effects on the larval stages.", "title": "Pre-hatching seawater pCO2 affects development and survival of zoea stages of Arctic spider crab Hyas araneus", "query": "Pre-hatching seawater pCO2 affects development and survival of zoea stages of Arctic spider crab Hyas araneus"}

Here we investigate effects of increased pCO2 on dissolved and particulate amino acids (AA) and carbohydrates (CHO), in arctic and sub-arctic planktonic communities in two large-scale mesocosm experiments. Dissolved AA concentrations responded to pCO2/pH changes during early bloom phases but did not show many changes after nutrient addition. A clear positive correlation in particulate AA was detected in post-bloom phases. Direct responses in CHO concentrations to changing pCO2/pH were lacking, suggesting that observed changes were rather indirect and dependent on the phytoplankton community composition. The relative composition of AA and CHO did not change as a direct consequence of pCO2 increase. Changes between bloom phases were associated with the prevailing nutrient status.

Redirected aggression has been reported in many vertebrates, but few quantitative studies have been conducted on this behaviour in fishes. We examined the function of redirected aggression in Julidochromis regani, a social cichlid fish. Behavioural experiments showed that redirected aggression functioned to divert the original aggressor's attention towards a third party and to pre-empt an attack towards the victim by the third-party individual, specifically among females. We found, however, that redirected aggression did not delay the recurrence of aggression by the original aggressor. These results suggest that a primary function of redirected aggression is to maintain the dominance of its actor against a subordinate occupying an adjacent rank.

The biological fixation of dinitrogen (N 2 ) to bioavailable nitrogen provides an important new source of nitrogen for pelagic marine ecosystems and influences primary productivity and organic matter export to the deep ocean. As one of a series of efforts to collect biomass and rates specific to different phytoplankton functional groups, we have constructed a database on diazotrophic organisms in the global pelagic upper ocean by compiling about 12 000 direct field measurements of cyanobacterial diazotroph abundances (based on microscopic cell counts or qPCR assays targeting the nifH genes) and N 2 fixation rates. Biomass conversion factors are estimated based on cell sizes to convert abundance data to diazotrophic biomass. The database is limited spatially, lacking large regions of the ocean especially in the Indian Ocean. The data are approximately log-normal distributed, and large variances exist in most sub-databases with non-zero values differing 5 to 8 orders of magnitude. Reporting the geometric mean and the range of one geometric standard error below and above the geometric mean, the pelagic N 2 fixation rate in the global ocean is estimated to be 62 (52-73) Tg N yr \u22121 and the pelagic diazotrophic biomass in the global ocean is estimated to be 2.1 (1.4-3.1) Tg C from cell counts and to 89 (43-150) Tg C from nifH-based abundances.

Uncertainties related to biomass conversion factors can change the estimate of geometric mean pelagic diazotrophic biomass in the global ocean by about \u00b1 70 %. It was recently established that the most commonly applied method used to measure N 2 fixation has underestimated the true rates. As a result, one can expect that future rate measurements will shift the mean N 2 fixation rate upward and may result in significantly higher estimates for the global N 2 fixation. The evolving database can nevertheless be used to study spatial and temporal distributions and variations of marine N 2 fixation, to validate geochemical estimates and to parameterize and validate biogeochemical models, keeping in mind that future rate measurements may rise in the future.

The initial accuracy of the adjusted concentrations is assessed by comparing the corrected data to laboratory measurements made on samples collected by a hydrographic cast with a rosette sampler at the float deployment station. The long-term accuracy of the corrected data is compared to the GLODAPv2 data set whenever a float made a profile within 20 km of a GLODAPv2 station. Based on these assessments, the fleet average oxygen data are accurate to 1\u00b11%, nitrate to within 0.5\u00b10.5 \u00b5mol kg-1, and pH to 0.005\u00b10.01, where the error limit is 1 standard deviation of the fleet data. The bio-optical measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence and optical backscatter are used to estimate chlorophyll a and particulate organic carbon concentration. The particulate organic carbon concentrations inferred from optical backscatter appear accurate to with 35 mg C m-3 or 20%, whichever is larger. Factors affecting the accuracy of the estimated chlorophyll a concentrations are evaluated.", "title": "Biogeochemical sensor performance in the SOCCOM profiling float array", "query": "Biogeochemical sensor performance in the SOCCOM profiling float array"}

In the present study, we obtained six strains of Bysmatrum from the South China Sea and French Atlantic coast by isolating single cells/cysts from plankton and sediment samples. All strains were examined with light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Based on morphological observations, three strains were identified as Bysmatrum subsalsum, characterized by the elongated and rectangular first and a hexagonal second anterior intercalary plate. They differ from each other in the number of sulcal lists and the configuration of the first anterior intercalary plate. One strain was identified as Bysmatrum gregarium and the other two as Bysmatrum granulosum. The cyst-theca relationship of B. subsalsum from the French Atlantic was established by incubation of the cyst, and the geochemical composition of the cyst wall was measured through micro-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Bysmatrum subsalsum from Malaysia shows a bright red stigma in the sulcal area under light microscopy, which was confirmed with transmission electron microscopy: it was identified as a type B eyespot. Small subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA), partial large subunit ribosomal DNA (LSU rDNA) and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences were obtained from all six strains. The maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference analysis based on concatenated SSU, ITS and LSU sequences revealed that Bysmatrum is monophyletic and nested within Peridiniales. Our strains of B. subsalsum form a new ribotype in the molecular phylogeny (designated as ribotype B).

We investigated how predicted ocean warming (OW) and acidification (OA) affect key ecological behaviours (locomotion speed and foraging success) and metabolic rate of a keystone marine mollusc, the sea hare Stylocheilus striatus, a specialist grazer of the toxic cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula. We acclimated sea hares to OW and/or OA across three developmental stages (metamorphic, juvenile, and adult) or as adults only, and compare these to sea hares maintained under current-day conditions. Generally, locomotion speed and time to locate food were reduced ~1.5-to 2-fold when the stressors (OW or OA) were experienced in isolation, but reduced ~3-fold when combined. Decision-making was also severely altered, with correct foraging choice nearly 40% lower under combined stressors. Metabolic rate appeared to acclimate to the stressors in isolation, but was significantly elevated under combined stressors. Overall, sea hares that developed under OW and/or OA exhibited a less severe impact, indicating beneficial phenotypic plasticity. Reduced foraging success coupled with increased metabolic demands may impact fitness in this species and highlight potentially large ecological consequences under unabated OW and OA, namely in regulating toxic cyanobacteria blooms on coral reefs.Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) levels may lead to continued and accelerated global warming over the coming century 1 . The resulting elevated sea surface temperature (SST) (i.e. ocean warming; OW) is accompanied by increased partial pressure of CO 2 (pCO 2 ) in the ocean, thus rapidly changing the marine environment by increasing acidity (i.e. ocean acidification; OA) at unprecedented rates 2 .

Many zones have also been identified that are suitable to host windfarms. A good understanding of interactions between these activities is necessary in order to estimate, forestall and manage risks of major spatial conflicts. Besides, their potential interactions with marine populations have not yet been well established. Several Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have been created in the Channel in the past few years, to protect key habitats or populations, or are still being discussed. It is necessary to predict to what extent these MPAs can be an asset for a sustainable exploitation of marine resources, and what their effects will be on the organisation of sectors that depend on these resources. Thus, modelling becomes a relevant approach. One major issue when trying to model marine ecosystems is that they have high uncertainties: marine populations and fishing intensity are very variable, and their state is often poorly known. These uncertainties increase risks that ecosystem management goals may not be reached. Therefore, management measures that are robust to uncertainties and minimise these risks have to be found. Methods have been developed within Decision Theory that aim at allowing decision making under severe uncertainty. One of these methods is the information-gap decision theory. The info-gap method has started to permeate ecological modelling, with recent applications to conservation. However, these practical applications have so far been restricted to rather simple models with analytical solutions. Here we set up a nonprobabilistic management measures robustness assessment approach based on decision theory for a complex, non-analytical model. This approach is applied to the management of the Eastern Channel flatfish fishery. Using the ISIS-Fish modelling platform, we model populations of sole and plaice in this area. A wide range of values of management parameters is tested, so that we can determine which values allow reaching maximum sustainable yield (MSY) with the highest robustness to uncertainties. This model is then further enhanced in order to evaluate the impacts of human activities on various elements of the Eastern Channel ecosystem, in a context of developing spatial management. Effects of MPAs on fishing activities, fish and benthic populations are modelled according to information found in the literature. Impacts of sediment extraction on benthic communities can be determined by means of data obtained on experimental dredging sites located in the Bay of Seine. This study took place from 2007 to 2012, the analysis being performed at the level of the trophic guilds that appear in the diets of sole and plaice. Based on these data, we determine the dynamics of benthic populations at the trophic guild level on dredged sites and on reference sites. These dynamics are then included in the ISIS-Fish model of the area. Finally, we test various management scenarios corresponding to different levels of access limitations to Marine Protected Areas. Among all scenarios tested, we search for those that allow reaching management goals, despite potentially large uncertainties on several parameters linked to the environment, human behavior, or fish biology., La Manche orientale est une zone strat\u00e9gique supportant de nombreuses activit\u00e9s humaines, notamment la p\u00eache, le transport de marchandises, l'extraction de granulats et le tourisme.

Un probl\u00e8me majeur rencontr\u00e9 lorsqu'on souhaite mod\u00e9liser un \u00e9cosyst\u00e8me marin est les fortes incertitudes auxquelles on est confront\u00e9 : les populations marines et leur niveau exploitation sont tr\u00e8s variables, et leur \u00e9tat est souvent mal connu. Ces incertitudes augmentent les risques de non atteinte des objectifs de gestion \u00e9cosyst\u00e9miques.

In this work we show that several strains of the highly abundant marine cyanobacterial genus Prochlorococcus exhibit growth defects when grown under ocean acidification conditions, but these defects disappear when they are grown in co-culture with another cyanobacterium, Synechococcus, which is often considered to be a direct competitor of Prochlorococcus. Indeed, the relative fitness of Prochlorococcus in competition with Synechococcus increases as Prochlorococcus becomes rarer, suggesting that they could co-exist indefinitely in competition over a single limiting nutrient. These results are among the first to examine direct competitions between these two important marine genera, and provide useful context for understanding the ecological and evolutionary forces that structure their communities in nature.", "title": "Co\u2010culture with Synechococcus facilitates growth of Prochlorococcus under ocean acidification conditions", "query": "Co\u2010culture with Synechococcus facilitates growth of Prochlorococcus under ocean acidification conditions"}

Unprecedented seafloor geodetic data reveal a >4-cm slip along the offshore extension of a fault related to flank kinematics during one 8-day-long event in May 2017, while displacement on land peaked at ~4 cm at the coast. As deformation increases away from the magmatic system, the bulk of Mount Etna's present continuous deformation must be driven by gravity while being further destabilized by magma dynamics. We cannot exclude flank movement to evolve into catastrophic collapse, implying that Etna's flank movement poses a much greater hazard than previously thought. The hazard of flank collapse might be underestimated at other coastal and ocean island volcanoes, where the dynamics of submerged flanks are unknown.", "title": "Gravitational collapse of Mount Etna's southeastern flank", "query": "Gravitational collapse of Mount Etna's southeastern flank"}

Yet, knowledge of the capacity of marine calcifiers to undergo metabolic adaptation is sparse.

Consequently, we conducted a multi-generation experiment and compared physiological responses of F1 mussels from \u2018tolerant\u2019 and \u2018sensitive\u2019 families exposed to OA for 1 year. Family classifications were based on larval survival; tolerant families settled at all PCO2 levels (700, 1120, 2400 \u00b5atm) while sensitive families did not settle at the highest PCO2 (\u226599.8% mortality). We found similar filtration rates between family types at the control and intermediate PCO2 level. However, at 2400 \u00b5atm, filtration and metabolic scope of gill tissue decreased in tolerant families, indicating functional limitations at the tissue level. Routine metabolic rates (RMR) and summed tissue respiration (gill and outer mantle tissue) of tolerant families were increased at intermediate PCO2, indicating elevated cellular homeostatic costs in various tissues. By contrast, OA did not affect tissue and routine metabolism of sensitive families. However, tolerant mussels were characterised by lower RMR at control PCO2 than sensitive families, which had variable RMR. This might provide the energetic scope to cover increased energetic demands under OA, highlighting the importance of analysing intra-population variability.

In our previous studies, we identified endonuclease-deficient PLEs that are associated with telomeres in bdelloid rotifers, small freshwater invertebrates best known for their long-term asexuality and high foreign DNA content. Completion of the high-quality draft genome sequence of the bdelloid rotifer Adineta vaga provides us with the opportunity to examine its genomic transposable element (TE) content, as well as TE impact on genome function and evolution.Results: We performed an exhaustive search of the A. vaga genome assembly, aimed at identification of canonical PLEs combining both the reverse transcriptase (RT) and the GIY-YIG endonuclease (EN) domains. We find that the RT/EN-containing Penelope families co-exist in the A. vaga genome with the EN-deficient RT-containing Athena retroelements. Canonical PLEs are present at very low copy numbers, often as a single-copy, and there is no evidence that they might preferentially co-mobilize EN-deficient PLEs. We also find that Penelope elements can participate in expansion of A. vaga multigene families via trans-action of their enzymatic machinery, as evidenced by identification of intron-containing host genes framed by the Penelope terminal repeats and characteristic targetsite duplications generated upon insertion. In addition, we find that Penelope open reading frames (ORFs) in several families have incorporated long stretches of coding sequence several hundred amino acids (aa) in length that are highly enriched in asparagine residues, a phenomenon not observed in other retrotransposons. Conclusions: Our results show that, despite their low abundance and low transcriptional activity in the A. vaga genome, endonuclease-containing Penelope elements can participate in expansion of host multigene families. We conclude that the terminal repeats represent the cis-acting sequences required for mobilization of the intervening region in trans by the Penelope-encoded enzymatic activities. We also hypothesize that the unusual capture of long N-rich segments by the Penelope ORF occurs as a consequence of peculiarities of its replication mechanism. These findings emphasize the unconventional nature of Penelope retrotransposons, which, in contrast to all other retrotransposon types, are capable of dispersing intron-containing genes, thereby questioning the validity of traditional estimates of gene retrocopies in PLE-containing eukaryotic genomes.", "title": "Endonuclease-containing Penelope retrotransposons in the bdelloid rotifer Adineta vaga exhibit unusual structural features and play a role in expansion of host gene families", "query": "Endonuclease-containing Penelope retrotransposons in the bdelloid rotifer Adineta vaga exhibit unusual structural features and play a role in expansion of host gene families"}

Yet evidence in favour of each of these contrasting hypotheses continues to emerge. In consequence, the fundamental nature of organismal thermal responses and its implications remain unresolved. Here, we investigate these ideas explicitly using a global dataset of 619 observations of four categories of organismal performance, spanning 14 phyla and 403 species. In agreement with both hypotheses, we show a positive relationship between the temperature of maximal performance rate (T opt ) and environmental temperature (T env ) for developmental rate and locomotion speed, but not growth or photosynthesis rate. Next, we demonstrate that relationships between T env and the maximal performance rate (U max ) are rarely significant and positive, as expected if a thermodynamic effect predominates. By contrast, a positive relationship between T opt and U max is always present, but markedly weaker than theoretically predicted.

We examine the variation in structure attributable to local environmental (i.e., lake chemical and physical variables) vs. dispersal predictors (i.e., overland and watercourse distances between lakes) using variation partitioning techniques. Overall, we show that less motile species (crustacean zooplankton and fish) are better predicted by spatial factors than by local environmental ones. Furthermore, we show that for zooplankton abundances, both overland and watercourse dispersal pathways are equally strong, though they may select for different components of the community, while for fish, only watercourses are relevant dispersal pathways. These results suggest that crustacean zooplankton and fish are more constrained by dispersal and therefore more likely to operate as a metacommunity than are bacteria and phytoplankton within this studied landscape.", "title": "THE ROLE OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND SPATIAL PROCESSES IN STRUCTURING LAKE COMMUNITIES FROM BACTERIA TO FISH", "query": "THE ROLE OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND SPATIAL PROCESSES IN STRUCTURING LAKE COMMUNITIES FROM BACTERIA TO FISH"}

In this process, the nest entrances are key locations at which foragers transfer food and information about the surrounding environment. We assume that the number of nest entrances regulates social exchanges between foragers and inner-nest workers, and hence influences the foraging efficiency of the whole colony. Here, we compared the foraging responses of Myrmica rubra colonies settled in either one-entrance or two-entrance nests. The total outflows of workers exploiting a sucrose food source were similar regardless of the number of nest entrances. However, in the two-entrance nests, the launching of recruitment was delayed, a pheromone trail was less likely to emerge between the nest and the food source, and recruits were less likely to reach the food target. As a result, an additional entrance through which information could transit decreased the efficiency of social foraging and ultimately led to a lower amount of retrieved food. Our study confirms the key-role of nest entrances in the transfer of information from foragers to potential recruits. The influence of the number of entrances on the emergence of a collective trail also highlights the spatially extended impact of the nest architecture that can shape foraging patterns outside the nest.", "title": "Multiple nest entrances alter foraging and information transfer in ants", "query": "Multiple nest entrances alter foraging and information transfer in ants"}

In the current sequencing age, phylogenomic analysis has proven to be a powerful tool, facilitating the increase in knowledge about diversity within the opsin subclasses and, so far, at least nine types of opsins have been identified. Within echinoderms, opsins have been studied in Echinoidea and Ophiuroidea, which do not possess proper image forming eyes, but rather widely dispersed dermal photoreceptors. However, most species of Asteroidea, the starfish, possess true eyes and studying them will shed light on the diversity of opsin usage within echinoderms and help resolve the evolutionary history of opsins. Results: Using high-throughput RNA sequencing, we have sequenced and analyzed the transcriptomes of different Acanthaster planci tissue samples: eyes, radial nerve, tube feet and a mixture of tissues from other organs. At least ten opsins were identified, and eight of them were found significantly differentially expressed in both eyes and radial nerve, with R-opsin being the most highly expressed in the eye.Conclusion:This study provides new important insight into the involvement of opsins in visual and nonvisual photoreception. Of relevance, we found the first indication of an r-opsin photopigment expressed in a welldeveloped visual eye in a deuterostome animal.

While previous studies focused on prominent periods of AMOC reduction during the last deglaciation, we aim to test whether similar reconfigurations of the subtropical hydrography occurred during the moderate climatic alterations punctuating the last interglacial Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5. Here, we present temperature and salinity records from a Florida Straits core by combining d 18 O and Mg/Ca analyses on surface (Globigerinoides ruber, white) and deep-dwelling (Globorotalia crassaformis) foraminifera covering MIS 5 in high resolution. The data reveal increasing salinities at intermediate depths during interglacial cooling episodes, decoupled from relatively stable surface conditions. This probably indicates the spatial expansion of saline subtropical gyre waters due to enhanced Ekman downwelling and might also point to a changed density structure and altered geostrophic balance in Florida Straits. Notably, these oceanographic alterations are not consistently occurring during periods of AMOC reduction. The data suggest that the expansion of gyre waters into Florida Straits was impeded by the increasing influence of Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) from MIS 5.5 to \u223c107 kyr BP. Afterward, increasingly positive benthic d 13 C values imply a recession of AAIW, allowing the temporary expansion of gyre waters into Florida Straits. We argue that the inferred transient subtropical salt accumulation and warm pool expansion might have played a pivotal role in reinvigorating meridional overturning and dampen the severity of interglacial cold phases.", "title": "Hydrological variability in Florida Straits during Marine Isotope Stage 5 cold events", "query": "Hydrological variability in Florida Straits during Marine Isotope Stage 5 cold events"}

Using a mesocosm approach, we investigated OA effects on a subtropical zooplankton community during oligotrophic, bloom, and post-bloom phases under a range of different pCO2 levels (from \u223c400 to \u223c1480 \u03bcatm). Furthermore, we simulated an upwelling event by adding 650 m-depth nutrient-rich water to the mesocosms, which initiated a phytoplankton bloom. No effects of pCO2 on the zooplankton community were visible in the oligotrophic conditions before the bloom. The zooplankton community responded to phytoplankton bloom by increased abundances in all treatments, although the response was delayed under high-pCO2 conditions. Microzooplankton was dominated by small dinoflagellates and aloricate ciliates, which were more abundant under medium- to high-pCO2 conditions. The most abundant mesozooplankters were calanoid copepods, which did not respond to CO2 treatments during the oligotrophic phase of the experiment but were found in higher abundance under medium- and high-pCO2 conditions toward the end of the experiment, most likely as a response to increased phyto- and microzooplankton standing stocks. The second most abundant mesozooplankton taxon were appendicularians, which did not show a response to the different pCO2 treatments. Overall, CO2 effects on zooplankton seemed to be primarily transmitted through significant CO2 effects on phytoplankton and therefore indirect pathways. We conclude that elevated pCO2 can change trophic cascades with significant effects on zooplankton, what might ultimately affect higher trophic levels in the future.

This signature can potentially be used as a tracer. On the shelf, the combination of river discharge and sea-ice formation, modifies water densities and mixing considerably. These waters are a source of the halocline layer that covers much of the Arctic Ocean, but also contain elevated levels of DOM. Here we demonstrate how this can be used as a supplementary tracer and contribute to evaluating ocean circulation in the Arctic. A fraction of the organic compounds that DOM consists of fluoresce and can be measured using in-situ fluorometers. When deployed on autonomous platforms these provide high temporal and spatial resolution measurements over long periods. The results of an analysis of data derived from several Ice Tethered Profilers (ITPs) offer a unique spatial coverage of the distribution of DOM in the surface 800m below Arctic sea-ice. Water mass analysis using temperature, salinity and DOM fluorescence, can clearly distinguish between the contribution of Siberian terrestrial DOM and marine DOM from the Chukchi shelf to the waters of the halocline. The findings offer a new approach to trace the distribution of Pacific waters and its export from the Arctic Ocean. Our results indicate the potential to extend the approach to separate freshwater contributions from, sea-ice melt, riverine discharge and the Pacific Ocean.  Key Points:  Arctic surface waters with comparable temperature and salinity have contrasting in situ dissolved organic matter fluorescence.  Organic matter fluorescence can tracklow salinity waters feeding into the Transpolar Drift and haloclinelayers.

(calibrated radiocarbon years). The period prior to 16.5 ka B.P. was characterized by stable conditions in all records until a distinct drop in d 18 O values combined with a sharp increase in 87 Sr/ 86 Sr occurred between 16.5 and 14.8 ka B.P. This event is attributed to an increased runoff from the northern drainage area of the Black Sea between Heinrich Event 1 and the onset of the B\u00f8lling warm period. While the Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca records remained rather unaffected by this inflow; they show an abrupt rise with the onset of the B\u00f8lling/Aller\u00f8d warm period. This rise was caused by calcite precipitation in the surface water, which led to a sudden increase of the Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca ratios of the Black Sea water. The stable oxygen isotopes also start to increase around 15 ka B.P., although in a more gradual manner, due to isotopically enriched meteoric precipitation. While Sr/Ca remains constant during the following interval of the Younger Dryas cold period, a decrease in the Mg/Ca ratio implies that the intermediate water masses of the Black Sea temporarily cooled by 1-2\u00b0C during the Younger Dryas. The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values drop after the cessation of the water inflow at 15 ka B.P. to a lower level until the Younger Dryas, where they reach values similar to those observed during the Last Glacial Maximum. This might point to a potential outflow to the Mediterranean Sea via the Sea of Marmara during this period. The inflow of Mediterranean water started around 9.3 ka B.P., which is clearly detectable in the abruptly increasing Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca, and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values.

Most likely, source rocks are Miocene organic-rich sediments and a potential Eocene source rock that may exist in the area if early rifting created sufficiently deep depocenters. Thermogenic methane production could thus explain the more widespread presence of gas hydrates north of the Knipovich Ridge. The presence of microbial methane on the upper continental slope and shelf indicates that the origin of methane on the Svalbard margin varies spatially.", "title": "Gas hydrate distribution and hydrocarbon maturation north of the Knipovich Ridge, western Svalbard margin", "query": "Gas hydrate distribution and hydrocarbon maturation north of the Knipovich Ridge, western Svalbard margin"}

In this study, the grain-size-sensitive (GSS) composite flow law of Goldsby and Kohlstedt (2001) was used to study the effects of grain size and premelting (liquid-like layer along the grain boundaries) on strain rate in the lower part of the NEEM ice core. The results show that the strain rates predicted in the fine-grained layers are about an order of magnitude higher than in the much coarser-grained layers. The dominant deformation mechanisms, based on the flow relation of Goldsby and Kohlstedt (2001), between the layers is also different, with basal slip rate limited by grain boundary sliding (GBS-limited creep) being the dominant deformation mechanism in the finer-grained layers, while GBS-limited creep and dislocation creep (basal slip rate limited by non-basal slip) contribute both roughly equally to bulk strain in the coarsegrained layers. Due to the large difference in microstructure between finer-grained ice and the coarse-grained ice at premelting temperatures (T > 262 K), it is expected that the fine-grained layers deform at high strain rates, while the coarse-grained layers are relatively stagnant. The difference in microstructure, and consequently in viscosity, between impurity-rich and low-impurity ice can have important consequences for ice dynamics close to the bedrock.", "title": "Using a composite flow law to model deformation in the NEEM deep ice core, Greenland \u2013 Part 2: The role of grain size and premelting on ice deformation at high homologous temperature", "query": "Using a composite flow law to model deformation in the NEEM deep ice core, Greenland \u2013 Part 2: The role of grain size and premelting on ice deformation at high homologous temperature"}

In the present study, we reviewed available data in the World Register of Marine Species, and found that 11,456 valid species of Recent polychaetes (1417 genera, 85 families) have been named by 835 first authors since 1758. Over this period, three discovery phases of the fauna were identified. That is, the initial phase (from 1758 to mid-nineteenth century) where nearly 500 species were described by few taxonomists, the second phase (from the 1850's to mid-twentieth century) where almost 5000 species were largely described by some very productive taxonomists, and the third phase (from the 1950's to modern times) in which about 6000 species were described by the most taxonomists ever. Six polychaete families with the most species were Syllidae (993 species), Polynoidae (876 species), Nereididae (687 species), Spionidae (612 species), Terebellidae (607 species) and Serpulidae (576 species). The increase in the number of first authors through time indicated greater taxonomic effort. By contrast, there was a decline in the number of polychaete species described in proportion to the number of first authors since around mid-nineteenth century. This suggested that it has been getting more difficult to find new polychaete species. According to our modelling, we predict that 5200 more species will be discovered between now and the year 2100. The total number of polychaete species of the world by the end of this century is thus anticipated to be about 16,700 species.", "title": "Progress and perspectives in the discovery of polychaete worms (Annelida) of the world", "query": "Progress and perspectives in the discovery of polychaete worms (Annelida) of the world"}

In comparison to the Atlantic Ocean, oxygenation data from the intermediate and deep waters of the Paci\ufb01c Ocean are relatively poor.

In this contribution, we present new carbon isotope data on bottom-water-living protists and abundance of redox-sensitive elements that highlight the availability of oxygen from a sediment core in the southern deep SCS. The data allow reconstruction of the oxygenation history of the SCSDW for the past 30,000 years. Our data are compared with other published oxygenation records from intermediate and deep waters in the Paci\ufb01c Ocean. The combined oxygenation records demonstrate that the SCSDW would have been sourced by the Paci\ufb01c Deep Water since the Last Glacial Maximum (21,000 years before present). The oxygenation records in the deep SCS appear to support the general circulation model results and paleo-proxy data in the North Paci\ufb01c, which suggest that a strengthened meridional overturning mainly occurred within intermediate waters during cold stadials of the last deglacial period.", "title": "Changes in Deep Water Oxygenation of the South China Sea Since the Last Glacial Period", "query": "Changes in Deep Water Oxygenation of the South China Sea Since the Last Glacial Period"}

The gradients were predominantly downward, i.e., concentrations decreased toward the surface. Ignoring these gradients causes a systematic error in regionally integrated gas exchange estimates, when using observed concentrations at several meters below the surface as input for bulk flux parameterizations -as is routinely practiced. Here we propose that multi-day near-surface stratification events are responsible for the observed near-surface N 2 O gradients, and that the gradients induce the strongest bias in gas exchange estimates at winds of about 3 to 6 m s \u22121 . Glider hydrographic time series reveal that events of multi-day nearsurface stratification are a common feature in the study region. In the same way as shorter events of near-surface stratification (e.g., the diurnal warm layer cycle), they preferentially exist under calm to moderate wind conditions, suppress turbulent mixing, and thus lead to isolation of the top layer from the waters below (surface trapping). Our observational data in combination with a simple gas-transfer model of the surface trapping mechanism show that multi-day nearsurface stratification can produce near-surface N 2 O gradients comparable to observations. They further indicate that N 2 O gradients created by diurnal or shorter stratification cycles are weaker and do not substantially impact bulk emission estimates. Quantitatively, we estimate that the integrated bias for the entire Peruvian upwelling region in December 2012 represents an overestimation of the total N 2 O emission by about a third, if concentrations at 5 or 10 m depth are used as surrogate for bulk water N 2 O concentration. Locally, gradients exist which would lead to emission rates overestimated by a factor of two or more. As the Peruvian upwelling region is an N 2 O source of global importance, and other strong N 2 O source regions could tend to develop multiday near-surface stratification as well, the bias resulting from multi-day near-surface stratification may also impact global oceanic N 2 O emission estimates.", "title": "Gas exchange estimates in the Peruvian upwelling regime biased by multi-day near-surface stratification", "query": "Gas exchange estimates in the Peruvian upwelling regime biased by multi-day near-surface stratification"}

We used KOH-KOBr to separate operationally defined total organic matter into oxidizable (labile) and residual fractions for content and isotope measurements. In a sediment core in the Okinawa Trough, significant amounts of carbon and nitrogen existed in the residual phase, in which the C/N ratio was ~9, resembling most documented sedimentary bulk C/N ratios in the China marginal seas.

Currently available data sets lack sufficient accuracy and/or thematic detail in many regions of the Arctic. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from satellites have already been shown to be suitable for wetland mapping. Envisat Advanced SAR (ASAR) provides global medium-resolution data which are examined with particular focus on spatial wetness patterns in this study. It was found that winter minimum backscatter values as well as their differences to summer minimum values reflect vegetation physiognomy units of certain wetness regimes. Low winter backscatter values are mostly found in areas vegetated by plant communities typically for wet regions in the tundra biome, due to low roughness and low volume scattering caused by the predominant vegetation. Summer to winter difference backscatter values, which in contrast to the winter values depend almost solely on soil moisture content, show expected higher values for wet regions. While the approach using difference values would seem more reasonable in order to delineate wetness patterns considering its direct link to soil moisture, it was found that a classification of winter minimum backscatter values is more applicable in tundra regions due to its better separability into wetness classes. Previous approaches for wetland detection have investigated the impact of liquid water in the soil on backscatter conditions. In this study the absence of liquid water is utilized.Owing to a lack of comparable regional to circumpolar data with respect to thematic detail, a potential wetland map cannot directly be validated; however, one might claim the validity of such a product by comparison with vegetation maps, which hold some information on the wetness status of certain classes. It was shown that the Envisat ASAR-derived classes are related to wetland classes of conventional vegetation maps, indicating its applicability; 30% of the land area north of the treeline was identified as wetland while conventional maps recorded 1-7%.", "title": "A novel approach for the characterization of tundra wetland regions with C-band SAR satellite data", "query": "A novel approach for the characterization of tundra wetland regions with C-band SAR satellite data"}

The analysis reveals that the MLS cycle is generally weak in comparison of individual physical processes entering in the budget because of strong compensation. In evaporative regions, around the surface salinity maxima, the ocean acts to freshen the mixed layer against the action of evaporation. Poleward of the southern SSS maxima, the freshening is ensured by geostrophic advection, the vertical salinity diffusion and, during winter, a dominant contribution of the convective entrainment. On the equatorward flanks of the SSS maxima, Ekman transport mainly contributes to supply freshwater from ITCZ regions while vertical salinity diffusion adds on the effect of evaporation. All these terms are phase locked through the effect of the wind. Under the seasonal march of the ITCZ and in coastal areas affected by river (78S:158N), the upper ocean freshening by precipitations and/or runoff is attenuated by vertical salinity diffusion. In the eastern equatorial regions, seasonal cycle of wind forced surface currents advect freshwaters, which are mixed with subsurface saline water because of the strong vertical turbulent diffusion. In all these regions, the vertical diffusion presents an important contribution to the MLS budget by providing, in general, an upwelling flux of salinity.

We collected 25 939 data points from several online databases and 41 scientific articles.

The biomass data has been gridded onto a 360 \u00d7 180 \u2022 grid, with a vertical resolution of 33 depth levels. Both the raw data file and the gridded data in NetCDF format can be downloaded from PANGAEA, doi:10.1594/PANGAEA.777387. Data were collected between 1950-2010, with sampling depths ranging from 0-2000 m. Pteropod biomass data was either extracted directly or derived through converting abundance to biomass with pteropod-specific length to carbon biomass conversion algorithms. In the Northern Hemisphere (NH), the data were distributed quite evenly throughout the year, whereas sampling in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) was biased towards winter and summer values. 86 % of all biomass values were located in the NH, most (37 %) within the latitudinal band of 30-60 \u2022 N.

The goal of this study was to improve PhytoDOAS, which is a new retrieval method for quantitative identification of major phytoplankton functional types (PFTs) using hyper-spectral satellite data. PhytoDOAS is an extension of the Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS, a method for detection of atmospheric trace gases), developed for remote identification of oceanic phytoplankton groups. Thus far, PhytoDOAS has been successfully exploited to identify cyanobacteria and diatoms over the global ocean from SCIAMACHY (SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY) hyper-spectral data. This study aimed to improve PhytoDOAS for remote identification of coccolithophores, another functional group of phytoplankton. The main challenge for retrieving more PFTs by PhytoDOAS is to overcome the correlation effects between different PFT absorption spectra. Different PFTs are composed of different types and amounts of pigments, but also have pigments in common, e.g. chl a, causing correlation effects in the usual performance of the PhytoDOAS retrieval. Two ideas have been implemented to improve PhytoDOAS for the PFT retrieval of more phytoplankton groups. Firstly, using the fourth-derivative spectroscopy, the peak positions of the main pigment components in each absorption spectrum have been derived. After comparing the corresponding results of major PFTs, the optimized fit-window for the PhytoDOAS retrieval of each PFT was determined. Secondly, based on the results from derivative spectroscopy, a simultaneous fit of PhytoDOAS has been proposed and tested for a selected set of PFTs (coccolithophores, diatoms and dinoflagellates) within an optimized fit-window, proven by spectral orthogonality tests. The method was then applied to the processing of SCIAMACHY data over the year 2005. Comparisons of the PhytoDOAS coccolithophore retrievals in 2005 with other coccolithophore-related data showed similar patterns in their seasonal distributions, especially in the North Atlantic and the Arctic Sea. The seasonal patterns of the PhytoDOAS coccolithophores indicated very good agreement with the coccolithophore modeled data from the NASA Ocean Biochemical Model (NOBM), as well as with the global distributions of particulate inorganic carbon (PIC), provided by MODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer)-Aqua level-3 products. Moreover, regarding the fact that coccolithophores belong to the group of haptophytes, the PhytoDOAS seasonal coccolithophores showed good agreement with the global distribution of haptophytes, derived from synoptic pigment relationships applied to SeaWiFS chl a. As a case study, the simultaneous mode of PhytoDOAS has been applied to SCIAMACHY data for detecting a coccolithophore bloom which was consistent with the MODIS RGB image and the MODIS PIC map of the bloom, indicating the functionality of the method also in short-term retrievals.", "title": "Improvement to the PhytoDOAS method for identification of coccolithophores using hyper-spectral satellite data", "query": "Improvement to the PhytoDOAS method for identification of coccolithophores using hyper-spectral satellite data"}

According to the distribution of 14 C and IR-OSL age determinations of Lena mouth sediments, the major river runoff direction shifted from the west during marine isotope stages 5-3 (third terrace deposits) towards the northwest during marine isotope stage 2 and transition to stage 1 (second terrace), to the northeast and east during the Holocene (first terrace deposits).

We show that the stress exponent, which best fits the observed state of the Greenland Ice Sheet, equals n=4, Our results, which are not dependent on a possible basal sliding component of flow, indicate that most of the interior northern ice sheet is currently frozen to bedrock, except for the large ice streams and marginal ice.

To determine the first component we need to know how \\soft\\ the ice is. By considering the flow velocities at the surface of the northern Greenland Ice Sheet and calculating the stresses that cause the flow, we determined that the ice is effectively softer than is usually assumed. Previous studies indicated that the base of the ice is thawed in large parts (up to about 50%) of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Our study shows that that is probably overestimated, because these studies assumed ice to be harder than it actually is. Our new assessment reduces the area with basal motion and thus melting to about 6-13% in the Greenland study area.", "title": "Greenland Ice Sheet: Higher Nonlinearity of Ice Flow Significantly Reduces Estimated Basal Motion", "query": "Greenland Ice Sheet: Higher Nonlinearity of Ice Flow Significantly Reduces Estimated Basal Motion"}

Here we show Pan-Arctic characteristics of CDOM light absorption for various Arctic regions covering both coastal and oceanic waters during the Tara Oceans Polar Circle expedition. The Siberian (or eastern) side of the AO is characterized by higher CDOM absorption values compared to the North American (or western) side. This is due to the difference in watersheds between the eastern and western sides of the AO and is consistent with an Arctic absorption database recently built by Matsuoka et al. (2014). A direct comparison between in situ and satellite data demonstrates that CDOM absorption is derived Arctic-wide from satellite ocean color data with an average uncertainty of 12% (root mean square error of 0.3 m \u2212 1 ) using our previously published algorithm. For river-influenced coastal waters, we found a single and highly significant relationship between concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and CDOM absorption (r 2 > 0.94) covering major Arctic river mouths. By applying this in situ relationship to satellite-derived CDOM absorption, DOC concentrations in the surface waters are estimated for river-influenced coastal waters with an average uncertainty of 28%. Implications for the monitoring of DOC concentrations in Arctic coastal waters are discussed.", "title": "Pan-Arctic optical characteristics of colored dissolved organic matter: Tracing dissolved organic carbon in changing Arctic waters using satellite ocean color data", "query": "Pan-Arctic optical characteristics of colored dissolved organic matter: Tracing dissolved organic carbon in changing Arctic waters using satellite ocean color data"}

The timescale covers the period 7.9-14.8 kyr before present and includes the B\u00f8lling, Aller\u00f8d, Younger Dryas, and early Holocene periods. We use a combination of new and previously published data, the most prominent being new high-resolution Continuous Flow Analysis (CFA) impurity records from the NGRIP ice core. Several investigators have identified and counted annual layers using a multiparameter approach, and the maximum counting error is estimated to be up to 2% in the Holocene part and about 3% for the older parts. These counting error estimates reflect the number of annual layers that were hard to interpret, but not a possible bias in the set of rules used for annual layer identification. As the GRIP and NGRIP ice cores are not optimal for annual layer counting in the middle and late Holocene, the timescale is tied to a prominent volcanic event inside the 8.2 kyr cold event, recently dated in the DYE-3 ice core to 8236 years before A. D. 2000 (b2k) with a maximum counting error of 47 years. The new timescale dates the Younger Dryas-Preboreal transition to 11,703 b2k, which is 100-150 years older than according to the present GRIP and NGRIP timescales. The age of the transition matches the GISP2 timescale within a few years, but viewed over the entire 7.9-14.8 kyr section, there are significant differences between the new timescale and the GISP2 timescale. The transition from the glacial into the B\u00f8lling interstadial is dated to 14,692 b2k. The presented timescale is a part of a new Greenland ice core chronology common to the DYE-3, GRIP, and NGRIP ice cores, named the Greenland Ice Core Chronology 2005 (GICC05). The annual layer thicknesses are observed to be log-normally distributed with good approximation, and compared to the early Holocene, the mean accumulation rates in the Younger Dryas and B\u00f8lling periods are found to be 47 \u00b1 2% and 88 \u00b1 2%, respectively.", "title": "A new Greenland ice core chronology for the last glacial termination", "query": "A new Greenland ice core chronology for the last glacial termination"}

Despite this, the importance of environment fluctuations, a key feature of climate change, has received little attention-selection experiments with marine phytoplankton are usually carried out in stable environments and use single or few representatives of a species, genus or functional group. Here we investigate whether and by how much environmental fluctuations contribute to changes in ecologically important phytoplankton traits such as C:N ratios and cell size, and test the variability of changes in these traits within the globally distributed species Ostreococcus. We have evolved 16 physiologically distinct lineages of Ostreococcus at stable high CO 2 (1031 \u00b1 87 \u03bcatm CO 2 , SH) and fluctuating high CO 2 (1012 \u00b1 244 \u03bcatm CO 2 , FH) for 400 generations. We find that although both fluctuation and high CO 2 drive evolution, FHevolved lineages are smaller, have reduced C:N ratios and respond more strongly to further increases in CO 2 than do SH-evolved lineages. This indicates that environmental fluctuations are an important factor to consider when predicting how the characteristics of future phytoplankton populations will have an impact on biogeochemical cycles and higher trophic levels in marine food webs.", "title": "Environmental stability affects phenotypic evolution in a globally distributed marine picoplankton", "query": "Environmental stability affects phenotypic evolution in a globally distributed marine picoplankton"}

Lagoons represent the \ufb01rst stage of a thermokarst lake transition to a marine setting and possibly more saline and colder upper boundary conditions. In this research, borehole data, electrical resistivity surveying, and modelling of heat and salt di\ufb00usion were carried out at Polar Fox Lagoon on the Bykovsky Peninsula, Siberia. Polar Fox Lagoon is a seasonally isolated water body connected to Tiksi Bay through a channel, leading to hypersaline waters under the ice cover. The boreholes in the centre of the lagoon revealed \ufb02oating ice and a saline cryotic bed underlain by a saline cryotic talik, a thin ice-bearing permafrost layer, and unfrozen ground. The bathymetry showed that most of the lagoon was ice-grounded in spring. In bedfast ice areas, the electrical resistivity pro\ufb01les suggest that an unfrozen saline layer was underlain by a thick layer of refrozen talik. The modelling suggests thermokarst lake taliks refreeze when submerged in saltwater with mean annual bottom water temperatures below or slightly above 0 \u25e6C. This occurs, because the top-down chemical degradation of newly formed ice-bearing permafrost is slower than the cooling of the talik. Hence, lagoons may pre-condition taliks with a layer of ice-bearing permafrost before encroachment by the sea and this frozen layer may act as a cap on gas migration out of the underlying talik.", "title": "Thermokarst Lake to Lagoon Transitions in Eastern Siberia: Do Submerged Taliks Refreeze?", "query": "Thermokarst Lake to Lagoon Transitions in Eastern Siberia: Do Submerged Taliks Refreeze?"}

In addition to the eff ects of the Kuroshio Current and westwardpropagating oceanic mesoscale eddies, the seas off eastern Taiwan, China, are frequently infl uenced by typhoons. Focusing on extrema of East Taiwan Channel volume transport (ETCVT) that appear within days of typhoon infl uence, this study investigated 124 historical cyclones including 91 typhoons that passed over the study sea area off eastern Taiwan, China. Based on 25-year HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) data, 71% of short-term (within 10 d) ETCVT absolute values with >5 Sv occurred under the infl uence of typhoons crossing the study sea area, and the maximum short-term ETCVT extrema induced by typhoons were 12.5 and -10.9 Sv. The ETCVT extrema induced by typhoons showed reasonable positive correlation with typhoon wind speed. More importantly, the ETCVT extrema diff ered in response to diff erent typhoon tracks. Three types of typhoon were identifi ed based on their track and impact on ETCVT. Representative typhoon cases were examined to elucidate the specifi cs of each typical response. Based on historical best track data and HYCOM data, it was established that Type I typhoons caused the ETCVT to exhibit a negative extremum followed by a positive extremum. All Type I, II, and III typhoons tended to result in typical ETCVT fl uctuations in the surface mixing layer above the depth of 50-100 m, while Type II typhoons were more likely to induce ETCVT fl uctuations in the subsurface layer. The fi ndings of this study enhance understanding of ETCVT extrema that occur following typhoon passage, which is valuable for short-term physical-biogeochemical studies both in the study region and in areas downstream owing to the large net volume transport changes induced by typhoons.", "title": "Volume transport in the East Taiwan Channel in response to different tracks of typhoons as revealed by HYCOM data", "query": "Volume transport in the East Taiwan Channel in response to different tracks of typhoons as revealed by HYCOM data"}

We also observed possibly nearly synchronous, millennial-scale changes of the ECS surface hydrography (mainly driven by salinity changes but also by temperature effects) and productivity coincident with monsoon events in the Hulu/Dongge stalagmite isotope records.

To analyze species sensitivity to environmental parameters, distributional and optimum ranges are derived by relating fluxes and relative abundances of the following seven species to sea surface temperature (SST) and export production normalized to 1000 m water depth: Globigerinoides ruber (white and pink), G. sacculifer, Globigerinella siphonifera, Globigerina bulloides and Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (dextral and sinistral coiling varieties).Of the warm-water species, G. ruber (white) and G. sacculifer exhibit the widest SST tolerance range (9.7/9.8-318C), followed by G. siphonifera (11.9-318C), while G. ruber (pink) shows the narrowest SST range (16.4-29.68C). G. bulloides and N. pachyderma (dex.) cover almost the whole SST range, N. pachyderma (dex.) exhibiting a clear preference for midtemperatures, while the distribution pattern of G. bulloides is polymodal due to different genetic types comprised in this morphologically defined category. The polar-subpolar species N. pachyderma (sin.) is absent at SSTs above 23.78C. The change in dominance of right-over left-coiled N. pachyderma is observed at 98C. Derived optimum ranges for all species are in good agreement with previous plankton tow and laboratory studies, while lower temperature limits for G. ruber (white) and G. sacculifer might be several degrees lower than previously reported. With the exception of the morphospecies G. bulloides, SST has a significant effect on all investigated species. However, it seems to be a governing factor for species fluxes only at the edges of the thermal tolerance range.The influence of export production on planktic foraminiferal fluxes and relative abundances is not as pronounced. Highest relative abundances of the symbiont-bearing and thus light-dependent species G. ruber, G. sacculifer and G. siphonifera are restricted to oligotrophic and mesotrophic conditions, even though high fluxes can be observed at high export productions as well. In contrast, the asymbiotic species G. bulloides and N. pachyderma (dex.), depending more on food, reach high fluxes and relative abundances even at very high rates of export production, where they can easily outnumber the symbiotic species.

In this study, the coccolithophorid Emiliania huxleyi was exposed to different pCO2 conditions (225\u2013900 \u00b5atm), in order to determine the role of natural organic ligands on the Fe(II) oxidation rate. Oxidation kinetics of Fe(II) were studied as a function of pH (7.75\u20138.25) and dissolved organic carbon levels produced (0\u2013141.11 \u00b5mol C L\u22121) during the different growth stages. The Fe(II) oxidation rate always decreased in the presence of exudates as compared to that in the exudates-free seawater. The organic ligands present in the coccolithophorid exudates were responsible for this decrease. The oxidation of Fe(II) in arti\ufb01cial seawater was also investigated at nanomolar levels over a range of pH (7.75\u20138.25) at 25\u25e6C in the presence of different glucuronic acid concentrations. Dissolved uronic acids (DUA) slightly increased the experimental rate compared to control arti\ufb01cial seawater (ASW) which can be ascribed to the stabilization of the oxidized form by chelation. This behavior was a function of the Fe(II):DUA ratio and was a pH dependent process. A kinetic model in ASW, with a single organic ligand, was applied for computing the equilibrium constant (log KFeCHO+ = 3.68 \u00b1 0.81 M\u22121) and the oxidation rate (log kFeCHO+ = 3.28 \u00b1 0.41 M\u22121 min\u22121) for the Fe(II)-DUA complex (FeCHO+), providing an excellent description of data obtained over a wide range of DUA concentrations and pH conditions. Considering the Marcus theory the Fe(III) complexing constant with DUA was limited to between 1013 and 1016. For the seawater enriched with exudates of E. huxleyi a second kinetic modeling approach was carried out for \ufb01tting the Fe(II) speciation, and the contribution of each Fe(II) species to the overall oxidation rate as a function of the pH/pCO2 conditions. The in\ufb02uence of organic ligands in the Fe(II) speciation diminished as pH decreased in solution. During the stationary growth phase, the FeCHO+ complex became the most important contributor to the overall oxidation rate when pH was lower than 7.95. Because CO2 levels modify the composition of excreted organic ligands, the redox behavior of Fe in solution may be affected by future acidi\ufb01cation conditions.", "title": "Effect of Organic Fe-Ligands, Released by Emiliania huxleyi, on Fe(II) Oxidation Rate in Seawater Under Simulated Ocean Acidification Conditions: A Modeling Approach", "query": "Effect of Organic Fe-Ligands, Released by Emiliania huxleyi, on Fe(II) Oxidation Rate in Seawater Under Simulated Ocean Acidification Conditions: A Modeling Approach"}

At the end of each cycle the floats remained at the sea surface for about 6 h, enough time to be localised and transmit the data to the Argos satellite system. The Argos positions were used to determine the float surface and intermediate displacements.At the surface, the float motion was approximated by a linear displacement and inertial motion. Intermediate velocities estimates were used to investigate the Mediterranean circulation at 350 m, to compute the pseudo-Eulerian statistics and to study the influence of bathymetry on the intermediate currents. Maximum speeds, as large as 33 cm/s, were found northeast of the Balearic Islands (western basin) and in the Ierapetra eddy (eastern basin). Typical speeds in the main along-slope currents (Liguro-Provenc \u00b8al-Catalan, Algerian and Libyo-Egyptian Currents) were \u223c20 cm/s. In the central and western part of Mediterranean basin, the pseudo-Eulerian statistics show typical intermediate circulation pathways which can be related to the motion of Levantine Intermediate Water. In general our results agree with the qualitative intermediate circulation schemes proposed in the literature, except in the southern Ionian where we found westward-flowing intermediate currents. Fluctuating currents appeared to be usually larger than the mean flow.

Particular concerns are the vertical mixing, the present and past abundance of nutrients in surface waters despite strong stratification, and the North Pacific-North Atlantic seesaw of oscillations in sea surface temperature (SST). We do this by generating and interpreting multiple records for glacial terminations I-V down two long piston cores, one each from the western and eastern subarctic Pacific. Chlorins and biogenic opal are proxies for surface water productivity; d 13 C of epibenthic foraminifera is a record of deepwater ventilation; and the d 13 C of N. pachyderma sin. is a tracer of nutrients in subsurface waters that extend up to the sea surface during times of vertical mixing. The degree of mixing is traced by pairing SST and d 18 O records of planktic surface and subsurface (pycnocline) dwellers. Tight age control is deduced from a suite of age-calibrated 14 C plateau boundaries for Termination I and benthic d 18 O and geomagnetic events for the last 800 ka. Carbon 14 paleoreservoir ages record the ages of surface and deep waters to uncover short-term changes in MOC over Termination I. We have defined a standard sequence of short-term productivity events for Termination I, also evident during terminations II to V and subsequent interglacials over the last 450 ka. The peak glacial regime of stable stratification and low productivity terminated, together with the end of ice rafting and melting, near 17 ka, $2000 years after the onset of Termination I. Pulses of vertical mixing and incursion of warm surface waters from the subtropics followed. Convected young water masses finally penetrated down to 3600-m water depth at 17.0 to less than 14.5 ka, significantly improving bottom water ventilation through the late deglacial and earliest interglacial. Mixing with upwelled nutrients from the pycnocline induced short-term maxima in algal production of chlorins and biogenic opal near 17-15 and 15-12 ka, respectively. Deglacial meltwater incursions in the Aleutian Current and silica input from North American rivers also promoted East Pacific productivity after 15.5 ka. Productivity decreased during the late deglacial and early interglacial, coeval with an exceptional peak in CaCO 3 preservation caused by both low organic flux and well-ventilated deepwater. Subsequently, low salinity and cool surface waters and in turn, stratification were gradually restored. A second, opaldominated productivity maximum marked the ends of interglacials. The deglacial pulses of vertical mixing around 17-11 ka imply an important contribution of the North Pacific to the coeval release of oceanic CO 2 into the atmosphere and support the east-west seesaw model of climate change.", "title": "Paleonutrient and productivity records from the subarctic North Pacific for Pleistocene glacial terminations I to V", "query": "Paleonutrient and productivity records from the subarctic North Pacific for Pleistocene glacial terminations I to V"}

The genes most affected by both genetics and environment were cyp19a1a and dmrt1, with contrasting sex-specific methylation and temperature responses. The relationship between cyp19a1a methylation and expression is relevant to the epigenetic regulation of vertebrate sex, and we report the evidence of such relationship only below a methylation threshold, ~ 80%, and that it was sex-specific: negatively correlated in females but positively correlated in males. From parents to offspring, the methylation in gonads was midway between oocytes and sperm, with bias towards oocytes for amh-r2, er-\u03b22, fsh-r and cyp19a1a. In contrast, dmrt1 levels resembled those of sperm.

Only one of these, LR, defined as the ratio of locally produced settlement to local egg production, has a clear relationship to selfpersistence of individual sites. However, SR, the ratio of locally produced settlement to settlement of all origins at a site, is generally easier to measure experimentally. We use theoretical, simulation, and empirical approaches to bridge the gap between these different indices, and demonstrate that there is a proportional relationship between SR and LR for metapopulations close to a stable state and with lifetime egg production (LEP) approximately uniform over space. Similarly, for systems where larval mortality rates are a relatively uniform function of release site, RLR (defined as the ratio of locally produced settlement to all settlement of local origin) and LR will also be proportional. Therefore, SR and RLR provide information on relative rates of LR for systems satisfying these conditions. Furthermore, the ratio between LR and SR can be used to evaluate global persistence of metapopulations, and therefore provides valuable information not necessarily available if only LR is considered.", "title": "Linking local retention, self-recruitment, and persistence in marine metapopulations", "query": "Linking local retention, self-recruitment, and persistence in marine metapopulations"}

We compare rates and patterns of evolution in eight linear measurements of body shape among fishes that live in pelagic, demersal and benthic habitats. While average body shape differs between habitats, these differences are subtle compared with the high diversity of shapes found within each habitat. Benthic living increases the rate of body shape evolution and has led to numerous lineages evolving extreme body shapes, including both exceptionally wide bodies and highly elongate, eel-like forms. By contrast, we find that benthic living is associated with the slowest diversification of structures associated with feeding. Though we find that habitat can serve as an impetus for predictable trait changes, we also highlight the diversity of responses in marine teleosts to opportunities presented by major habitats.", "title": "Body shape diversification along the benthic\u2013pelagic axis in marine fishes", "query": "Body shape diversification along the benthic\u2013pelagic axis in marine fishes"}

The authors present a cost neutral ice sensing algorithm (ISA), which alerts for the likely presence of sea ice. In this event, the profile is aborted and no surfacing attempted. To retrospectively track floats that actively remained under the sea ice because of ISA, acoustic tracking via the RAFOS technique was tested in the Weddell Sea.

However, the ecological effects of such structures on the natural surroundings remain unclear. We investigated the impact of experimentally introduced tetrapod fields on the demersal fish community in a hard-bottom area in the southern North Sea. The results indicated a significant decrease in fish abundance in the surrounding area caused by migration effects towards the artificial structures. Diversity (HB) and evenness (E) values exhibited greater variation after the introduction of the tetrapods. Additionally, a distinct increase in young-of-theyear (YOY) fish was observed near the structures within the second year after introduction. We suggest that the availability of adequate refuges in combination with additional food resources provided by the artificial structures has a highly species-specific attraction effect. However, these findings also demonstrate that our knowledge regarding the impact of artificial structures on temperate fish communities is still too limited to truly understand the ecological processes that are initiated by the introduction of artificial structures.

This process replenishes the deep ocean with oxygen and is central to maintaining its thermohaline properties. The deepest and densest mixed layers in the Greenland Sea were located within its cyclonic gyre and exhibited large interannual variability. Beginning in winter 1994, a transition to deeper (.500 m) mixed layers took place. This resulted in the formation of a new, less dense class of intermediate water that has since become the main product of convection in the Greenland Sea. In the preceding winters, convection was limited to ,300-m depth, despite strong atmospheric forcing. Sensitivity studies, performed with a one-dimensional mixed layer model, suggest that the deeper convection was primarily the result of reduced water-column stability. While anomalously fresh conditions that increased the stability of the upper part of the water column had previously inhibited convection, the transition to deeper mixed layers was associated with increased near-surface salinities. Our analysis further suggests that the volume of the new class of intermediate water has expanded in line with generally increased depths of convection over the past 10-15 years. The mean export of this water mass from the Greenland Sea gyre from 1994 to present was estimated to be 0.9 6 0.7 Sv (1 Sv [ 10 6 m 3 s 21 ), although rates in excess of 1.5 Sv occurred in summers following winters with deep convection.Denotes content that is immediately available upon publication as open access.", "title": "Water Mass Transformation in the Greenland Sea during the Period 1986\u20132016", "query": "Water Mass Transformation in the Greenland Sea during the Period 1986\u20132016"}
