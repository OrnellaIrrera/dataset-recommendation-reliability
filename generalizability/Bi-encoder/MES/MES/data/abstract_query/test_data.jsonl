Overall, our data show that, besides important current limitations, SAGs can still provide interesting and novel insights from poorlyknown, uncultured organisms."}

These negative consequences of OA on marine calci\ufb01ers, i.e. oyster species, have been very well documented in recent studies; however, the consequences of reduced or impaired calci\ufb01cation on the end-product, shells or skeletons, still remain one of the major research gaps. Shells produced by marine organisms under OA are expected to show signs of dissolution, disorganized microstructure and reduced mechanical properties. To bridge this knowledge gap and to test the above hypothesis, we investigated the effect of OA on juvenile shells of the commercially important oys- ter species, Magallana angulata, at ecologically and climati- cally relevant OA levels (using pH 8.1, 7.8, 7.5, 7.2). In lower pH conditions, a drop of shell hardness and stiffness was revealed by nanoindentation tests, while an evident porous internal microstructure was detected by scanning electron microscopy.

These negative consequences of OA on marine calci\ufb01ers, i.e. oyster species, have been very well documented in recent studies; however, the consequences of reduced or impaired calci\ufb01cation on the end-product, shells or skeletons, still remain one of the major research gaps. Shells produced by marine organisms under OA are expected to show signs of dissolution, disorganized microstructure and reduced mechanical properties. To bridge this knowledge gap and to test the above hypothesis, we investigated the effect of OA on juvenile shells of the commercially important oys- ter species, Magallana angulata, at ecologically and climati- cally relevant OA levels (using pH 8.1, 7.8, 7.5, 7.2). In lower pH conditions, a drop of shell hardness and stiffness was revealed by nanoindentation tests, while an evident porous internal microstructure was detected by scanning electron microscopy.

The climatology shows that both Northern Hemisphere subtropical gyres have a qualitatively very similar stratification structure.

Arctic lakes have different origins and include the predominant thermokarst lakes, which are small, young and highly dynamic, as well as large, old and stable glacial lakes. Freshwater diatoms dominate the primary producer community in these lakes and can be used to detect biotic responses to climate and environmental change. We used specific diatom metabarcoding on sedimentary DNA, combined with next-generation sequencing and diatom morphology, to assess diatom diversity in five glacial and 15 thermokarst lakes within the easternmost expanse of the Siberian treeline ecotone in Chukotka, Russia. We obtained 163 verified diatom sequence types and identified 176 diatom species morphologically. Although there were large differences in taxonomic assignment using the two approaches, they showed similar high abundances and diversity of Fragilariceae and Aulacoseiraceae. In particular, the genetic approach detected hidden within-lake variations of fragilarioids in glacial lakes and dominance of centric Aulacoseira species, whereas Lindavia ocellata was predominant using morphology. In thermokarst lakes, sequence types and valve counts also detected high diversity of Fragilariaceae, which followed the vegetation gradient along the treeline. Ordination analyses of the genetic data from glacial and thermokarst lakes suggest that concentrations of sulfate (SO42\u2212), an indicator of the activity of sulfate-reducing microbes under anoxic conditions, and bicarbonate (HCO3\u2212), which relates to surrounding vegetation, have a significant influence on diatom community composition. For thermokarst lakes, we also identified lake depth as an important variable, but SO42\u2212 best explains diatom diversity derived from genetic data, whereas HCO3\u2212 best explains the data from valve counts. Higher diatom diversity was detected in glacial lakes, most likely related to greater lake age and different edaphic settings, which gave rise to diversification and endemism. In contrast, small, dynamic thermokarst lakes are inhabited by stress-tolerant fragilarioids and are related to different vegetation types along the treeline ecotone. Our study demonstrated that genetic investigations of lake sediments can be used to interpret climate and environmental responses of diatoms.

Freshwater diatoms dominate the primary producer community in these lakes and can be used to detect biotic responses to climate and environmental change. We used specific diatom metabarcoding on sedimentary DNA, combined with next-generation sequencing and diatom morphology, to assess diatom diversity in five glacial and 15 thermokarst lakes within the easternmost expanse of the Siberian treeline ecotone in Chukotka, Russia. We obtained 163 verified diatom sequence types and identified 176 diatom species morphologically. Although there were large differences in taxonomic assignment using the two approaches, they showed similar high abundances and diversity of Fragilariceae and Aulacoseiraceae. In particular, the genetic approach detected hidden within-lake variations of fragilarioids in glacial lakes and dominance of centric Aulacoseira species, whereas Lindavia ocellata was predominant using morphology. In thermokarst lakes, sequence types and valve counts also detected high diversity of Fragilariaceae, which followed the vegetation gradient along the treeline. Ordination analyses of the genetic data from glacial and thermokarst lakes suggest that concentrations of sulfate (SO42\u2212), an indicator of the activity of sulfate-reducing microbes under anoxic conditions, and bicarbonate (HCO3\u2212), which relates to surrounding vegetation, have a significant influence on diatom community composition. For thermokarst lakes, we also identified lake depth as an important variable, but SO42\u2212 best explains diatom diversity derived from genetic data, whereas HCO3\u2212 best explains the data from valve counts. Higher diatom diversity was detected in glacial lakes, most likely related to greater lake age and different edaphic settings, which gave rise to diversification and endemism. In contrast, small, dynamic thermokarst lakes are inhabited by stress-tolerant fragilarioids and are related to different vegetation types along the treeline ecotone. Our study demonstrated that genetic investigations of lake sediments can be used to interpret climate and environmental responses of diatoms. It also showed how lake type affects diatom diversity, and that such genetic analyses can be used to track diatom community changes under ongoing warming in the Arctic."}

It usually inhabits various low-oxygen habitats, burrows inside the mudflat, and sometimes \\walks\\ to search for suitable environments during summer. It has evolved accessory air-breathing organs for respiring air and corresponding mechanisms to survive in such challenging environments. Thereby, it serves as a great model for understanding adaptations to terrestrial life. Results: Comparative genomics with channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) revealed specific adaptations of C. batrachus in DNA repair, enzyme activator activity, and small GTPase regulator activity. Comparative analysis with 11 non-air-breathing fish species suggested adaptive evolution in gene expression and nitrogenous waste metabolic processes. Further, myoglobin, olfactory receptor related to class A G protein-coupled receptor 1, and sulfotransferase 6b1 genes were found to be expanded in the air-breathing walking catfish genome, with 15, 15, and 12 copies, respectively, compared to non-air-breathing fishes that possess only 1-2 copies of these genes.

It usually inhabits various low-oxygen habitats, burrows inside the mudflat, and sometimes \\walks\\ to search for suitable environments during summer. It has evolved accessory air-breathing organs for respiring air and corresponding mechanisms to survive in such challenging environments. Thereby, it serves as a great model for understanding adaptations to terrestrial life. Results: Comparative genomics with channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) revealed specific adaptations of C. batrachus in DNA repair, enzyme activator activity, and small GTPase regulator activity.

In parallel, geometric morphometric analysis of shell outlines was used to test for associations between shell shape, latitude and genotype, and for a selection of shells we measured the thickness and organic content of the granular prismatic (PR), the crossed-lamellar (CL) and the complex crossed-lamellar (CCL) layers.

We collected 266 samples spanning a latitudinal cline from the Mediterranean to the North Sea and genotyped them at 12 microsatellite loci. In parallel, geometric morphometric analysis of shell outlines was used to test for associations between shell shape, latitude and genotype, and for a selection of shells we measured the thickness and organic content of the granular prismatic (PR), the crossed-lamellar (CL) and the complex crossed-lamellar (CCL) layers. Strong population structure was detected, with Bayesian cluster analysis identifying four groups located in the Mediterranean, Celtic Sea, along the continental coast of the North Sea and in Scotland.

Calcifying organisms that live in the waters off the WAP respond to temporal and spatial variations in ocean temperature and chemistry. These marine calcifiers are potentially threatened by regional climate change with waters already naturally close to carbonate undersaturation. Future projections of carbonate production in the Southern Ocean are challenging due to the lack of historical data collection and complex, decadal climate variability. Here we present a 6-yearlong record of the shell fluxes, morphology and stable isotope variability of the polar planktic foraminifera Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (sensu stricto) from near Palmer Station, Antarctica. This species is fundamental to Southern Ocean planktic carbonate production as it is one of the very few planktic foraminifer species adapted to the marine polar en-vironments. We use these new data to obtain insights into its ecology and to derive a robust assessment of the response of this polar species to environmental change. Morphology and stable isotope composition reveal the presence of different growth stages within this tightly defined species. Inter-and intra-annual variability of foraminiferal flux and size is evident and driven by a combination of environmental forcing parameters, most importantly food availability, temperature and sea ice duration and extent. Foraminiferal growth occurs throughout the austral year and is influenced by environmental change, a large portion of which is driven by the Southern Annular Mode and El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation.

Calcifying organisms that live in the waters off the WAP respond to temporal and spatial variations in ocean temperature and chemistry. These marine calcifiers are potentially threatened by regional climate change with waters already naturally close to carbonate undersaturation. Future projections of carbonate production in the Southern Ocean are challenging due to the lack of historical data collection and complex, decadal climate variability. Here we present a 6-yearlong record of the shell fluxes, morphology and stable isotope variability of the polar planktic foraminifera Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (sensu stricto) from near Palmer Station, Antarctica. This species is fundamental to Southern Ocean planktic carbonate production as it is one of the very few planktic foraminifer species adapted to the marine polar en-vironments. We use these new data to obtain insights into its ecology and to derive a robust assessment of the response of this polar species to environmental change. Morphology and stable isotope composition reveal the presence of different growth stages within this tightly defined species. Inter-and intra-annual variability of foraminiferal flux and size is evident and driven by a combination of environmental forcing parameters, most importantly food availability, temperature and sea ice duration and extent. Foraminiferal growth occurs throughout the austral year and is influenced by environmental change, a large portion of which is driven by the Southern Annular Mode and El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation. A distinct seasonal production is observed, with the highest shell fluxes during the warmest and most productive months of the year.

Species density (SpD), the exponential Shannon diversity index (e H\u2032 ) and Heip's index of evenness (E ~') were measured at different spatial scales. Continuous surfaces of each were created to 2000 m depth using predictive distribution models based on random forest (RF) algorithms. When fishing effort was included as an independent variable in the RF models, it was the most important predictor of sample SpD but unimportant in predicting e H\u2032 and only a minor predictor of E ~'. In the absence of a historical baseline, we used a novel approach to evaluate spatial impacts of fishing on diversity by simulating and comparing spatial SpD prediction surfaces using response data associated with different levels of fishing effort.

Continuous surfaces of each were created to 2000 m depth using predictive distribution models based on random forest (RF) algorithms. When fishing effort was included as an independent variable in the RF models, it was the most important predictor of sample SpD but unimportant in predicting e H\u2032 and only a minor predictor of E ~'.

It is known that retroviruses and other retro-transcribing viruses evolve from LTR retrotransposons and that this whole system clusters into five families: Ty3/Gypsy, Retroviridae, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao and Caulimoviridae. Phylogenetic analyses usually show that these split into multiple distinct lineages but what is yet to be understood is how deep evolution occurred in this system.Results:We combined phylogenetic and graph analyses to investigate the history of LTR retroelements both as a tree and as a network. We used 268 non-redundant LTR retroelements, many of them introduced for the first time in this work, to elucidate all possible LTR retroelement phylogenetic patterns.

It is known that retroviruses and other retro-transcribing viruses evolve from LTR retrotransposons and that this whole system clusters into five families: Ty3/Gypsy, Retroviridae, Ty1/Copia, Bel/Pao and Caulimoviridae. Phylogenetic analyses usually show that these split into multiple distinct lineages but what is yet to be understood is how deep evolution occurred in this system.Results:We combined phylogenetic and graph analyses to investigate the history of LTR retroelements both as a tree and as a network.

To better understand the reaction of Arctic coasts to increasing environmental pressure, shoreline position changes along a 210-km length of the Yukon Territory coast in northwest Canada were investigated for the time period from 1951 to 2015.

Additionally, measurements of shoreline positions from field sites were used to analyze coastal dynamics from 1991 to 2015. The mean shoreline change rate was \u00c01.3 m/a between the 1950s and 1970s and followed by a decrease to \u00c00.5 m/a between the 1970s to 1990s. This was followed by a significant increase in mean shoreline change rates again to \u00c01.3 m/a in the 1990s to 2011 time period. This acceleration in erosion is confirmed by field measurements that indicate increased erosion rates at high local rates up to \u00c08.9 m/a since 2006.

Ground surveys and observations with remote sensing data indicate that the current rate of shoreline retreat along some parts of the Yukon coast is higher than at any time before in the 64-year-long observation record. Enhanced availability of material in turn might favor the buildup of gravel features, which have been growing in extent throughout the last six decades.Plain Language Summary The Arctic is warming, but the impacts on its coasts are not well documented. To better understand the reaction of Arctic coasts to increasing environmental pressure, shoreline position changes along a 210-km length of the Yukon Territory coast in northwest Canada were investigated for the time period from 1951 to 2015. Shoreline positions were extracted from historical aerial images from the 1950s, 1970s, and 1990s and from satellite images from 2011. Additionally, measurements of shoreline positions from field sites were used to analyze coastal dynamics from 1991 to 2015. The mean shoreline change rate was \u00c01.3 m/a between the 1950s and 1970s and followed by a decrease to \u00c00.5 m/a between the 1970s to 1990s. This was followed by a significant increase in mean shoreline change rates again to \u00c01.3 m/a in the 1990s to 2011 time period. This acceleration in erosion is confirmed by field measurements that indicate increased erosion rates at high local rates up to \u00c08.9 m/a since 2006. Enhanced coastal erosion might, in turn, favor the buildup of gravel features, which have been growing in extent throughout the last six decades."}

This study exemplifies the importance of understanding changes in coastal carbonate chemistry through the lens of biogeochemical cycling at the land-sea interface. This is the first coastal acidification time series providing multiyear data at high temporal resolution. The data confirm rapid warming in the Mediterranean Sea and demonstrate coastal acidification with a synchronous increase in total alkalinity."}

Computer analysis of the localization of the restriction sites in human genome has allowed us to propose an efficient technique for generating DNA probes by LA-PCR using the restriction endonucleases Hae III and Rsa I. In silico hydrolysis of human genomic DNA with endonucleases Hae III and Rsa I demonstrate that 100- to 1,000-bp DNA fragments are more abundant in the gene-rich regions. Applying in situ hybrid- ization to metaphase chromosomes, we demonstrated that the produced DNA probes predominantly hybridized to the C-negative chromosomal regions, whereas the FISH signal was almost absent in the C-positive regions. The described protocol for generating DNA probes may be successfully used in subsequent cytogenetic analysis of the C-negative chromosomal regions."}

Our calculations showed that the Mingulay Reef overturned three to seven (with a mean of four) times more C than a soft-sediment area at a similar depth. As proof of concept, the supply of C needed from surface water primary productivity to the reef was inferred. Since 65\u2013124 T C year\u22121 is supplied by natural deposition and our study suggested that a mean of 241 T C year\u22121 (range 160\u2013400 T C year\u22121), was turned over by the reef, a mean of 117\u2013176 T C year\u22121 (range 36\u2013335 T C year\u22121) of the reef would therefore be supplied by tidal downwelling and/or deep-water advection. Our results indicate that monitoring and/or managing surface primary productivity would be a key consideration for any efforts towards the conservation of cold-water coral reef ecosystems."}

Accurate but sparse in situ temperature and salinity profiles (mainly from Argo for the last 10 yr) are merged with the lower accuracy but high-resolution synthetic data derived from satellite altimeter and sea surface temperature observations to provide global 3-D temperature and salinity fields at high temporal and spatial resolution. The first step of the method consists in deriving synthetic temperature fields from altimeter and sea surface temperature observations, and salinity fields from altimeter observations, through multiple/simple linear regression methods.

Results show the revolutionary nature of the Argo observing system. Argo observations now allow a global description of the statistical relationships that exist between surface and subsurface fields needed for step 1 of the method, and can constrain the large-scale temperature and mainly salinity fields during step 2 of the method. Compared to the use of climatological estimates, results indicate that up to 50% of the variance of the temperature fields can be reconstructed from altimeter and sea surface temperature observations and a statistical method. For salinity, only about 20 to 30% of the signal can be reconstructed from altimeter observations, making the in situ observing system essential for salinity estimates. The in situ observations (step 2 of the method) further reduce the differences between the gridded products and the observations by up to 20% for the temperature field in the mixed layer, and the main contribution is for salinity and the near surface layer with an improvement up to 30%.

We analyzed an unprecedented BGC-Argo database of more than 8,500 multivariable profiles collected in various oceanic conditions, from subpolar waters to subtropical gyres. Our objective is to refine previously established Chla versus b bp relationships and gain insights into the sources of vertical, seasonal, and regional variability in this relationship. Despite some regional, seasonal and vertical variations, a general covariation occurs at a global scale. We distinguish two main contrasted situations: (1) concomitant changes in Chla and b bp that correspond to actual variations in phytoplankton biomass, e.g., in subpolar regimes; (2) a decoupling between the two variables attributed to photoacclimation or changes in the relative abundance of nonalgal particles, e.g., in subtropical regimes.

In addition to temperature/salinity measurements, Biogeochemical-Argo (BGC-Argo) profiling floats are capable of autonomously observing at highfrequency bio-optical properties such as the chlorophyll fluorescence, a proxy of the chlorophyll a concentration (Chla), the particulate backscattering coefficient (b bp ), a proxy of the stock of particulate organic carbon, and the light available for photosynthesis. We analyzed an unprecedented BGC-Argo database of more than 8,500 multivariable profiles collected in various oceanic conditions, from subpolar waters to subtropical gyres. Our objective is to refine previously established Chla versus b bp relationships and gain insights into the sources of vertical, seasonal, and regional variability in this relationship. Despite some regional, seasonal and vertical variations, a general covariation occurs at a global scale. We distinguish two main contrasted situations: (1) concomitant changes in Chla and b bp that correspond to actual variations in phytoplankton biomass, e.g., in subpolar regimes; (2) a decoupling between the two variables attributed to photoacclimation or changes in the relative abundance of nonalgal particles, e.g., in subtropical regimes. The variability in the b bp :Chla ratio in the surface layer appears to be essentially influenced by the type of particles and by photoacclimation processes. The large BGC-Argo database helps identifying the spatial and temporal scales at which this ratio is predominantly driven by one or the other of these two factors."}

They were characterized by substantial surface cooling (\u22122.3 and \u22121.8 \u2022 C, respectively) and freshening (\u22120.6 and \u22120.5 PSU, respectively) as well as severe sea ice advance east of Newfoundland and south of Greenland, reaching as far as the Iceland Basin in the northeastern Atlantic at the climaxes of the cold events. Convection and deep-water formation in the northwestern Atlantic collapsed during the events, while the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation was not substantially affected (weakening by only about 10 % and 5 %, respectively). The events were triggered by prolonged phases of a positive North Atlantic Oscillation that caused substantial changes in the subpolar ocean circulation and associated freshwater transports, resulting in a weakening of the subpolar gyre. Our results suggest a possible mechanism by which abrupt cold events in the North Atlantic region may be triggered by internal climate variability without the need of an external (e.g., solar or volcanic) forcing."}

Our study highlights that western Europe underwent significant oscillations of (annual) SST during the last 10 kyr. During well-known intervals of mild boreal climate, warm shifts of more than 3 \u2022 C per century are accurately concomitant with positive sea-surface temperature anomalies and rise of mi-cropalaeontological indicators of gyre dynamics in the northern North Atlantic, pointing to periods of greater intensity of the North Atlantic Current (SPG cell especially). Conversely, the SST signal records short-term cold anomalies which could be related to weaker SPG dynamics."}

We compare the WAGHC climatology to the 1/4 \u2022 resolution isobarically averaged WOA13 climatology, produced by the NOAA Ocean Climate Laboratory (Locarnini et al., 2013) and diagnose a generally good agreement between these two gridded products. The differences between the two climatologies are basically attributed to the interpolation method and the considerably extended data basis. Specifically, the WAGHC climatology improved the representation of the thermohaline structure, in both the data poor polar regions and several data abundant regions like the Baltic Sea, the Caspian sea, the Gulf of California, the Caribbean Sea, and the Weddell Sea. Further, the dependence of the ocean heat content anomaly (OHCA) time series on the baseline climatology was tested. Since the 1950s, both of the baseline climatologies produce almost identical OHCA time series. The gridded dataset can be found at https://doi.org/10.1594/WDCC/WAGHC_V1.0 (Gouretski, 2018)."}

For establishing their chronology, major reversals of the earth's magnetic field provided initial tie points for the age model, confirming that the impact occurred in the earliest geomagnetic Gauss chron. Various stratigraphic parameters, reflecting redox conditions at the lake floor and climatic conditions in the catchment were tuned synchronously to Northern Hemisphere insolation variations and the marine oxygen isotope stack, respectively. Thus, a robust age model comprising more than 600 tie points could be defined. It could be shown that deposition of sediments in Lake El'gygytgyn occurred in concert with global climatic cycles. The upper \u223c 160 m of sediments represent the past 3.3 Ma, equivalent to sedimentation rates of 4 to 5 cm ka \u22121 , whereas the lower 160 m represent just the first 0.3 Ma after the impact, equivalent to sedimentation rates in the order of 45 cm ka \u22121 . This study also provides orbitally tuned ages for a total of 8 tephras deposited in Lake El'gygytgyn."}

Ice-penetrating radar is used to map variations in ice-layer thickness within the upper 100 m of the ice sheet. The route passes several firn-and ice-core drilling sites over a distance of 320 km. Dielectric-profiling data of ice cores are used to calculate the depths of selected reflection horizons and the cumulative mass of the ice column. The local surface mass balance is determined as a temporal average, covering a time-span of almost two centuries. The findings indicate a complex accumulation pattern superimposed on a generally low surface mass balance, which is related to small-scale surface undulations. The results of the radar soundings are in general in good agreement with surface mass-balance data derived from firn-core studies. Discrepancies between these two datasets can be explained by spatial mismatch or by minor quality of either ice-core profiles or radar data.

Ice-penetrating radar is used to map variations in ice-layer thickness within the upper 100 m of the ice sheet. The route passes several firn-and ice-core drilling sites over a distance of 320 km. Dielectric-profiling data of ice cores are used to calculate the depths of selected reflection horizons and the cumulative mass of the ice column. The local surface mass balance is determined as a temporal average, covering a time-span of almost two centuries. The findings indicate a complex accumulation pattern superimposed on a generally low surface mass balance, which is related to small-scale surface undulations. The results of the radar soundings are in general in good agreement with surface mass-balance data derived from firn-core studies. Discrepancies between these two datasets can be explained by spatial mismatch or by minor quality of either ice-core profiles or radar data. For regional comparison of radar-based accumulation data we use an accumulation distribution interpolated from point measurements. The surface mass balance varies up to 50% over short distances, with correlation lengths of <10 km.

The IAP is sandwiched between the Calabrian and Hellenic subduction zones in the central Mediterranean. A NNE-SSW-oriented 131 km long seismic refraction and wide-angle reflection profile, consisting of eight ocean bottom seismometers and hydrophones, was acquired in 2014. The profile was designed to univocally confirm the proposed oceanic nature of the IAP crust as a remnant of the Tethys and to confute its interpretation as a strongly thinned part of the African continental crust.

The IAP is sandwiched between the Calabrian and Hellenic subduction zones in the central Mediterranean. A NNE-SSW-oriented 131 km long seismic refraction and wide-angle reflection profile, consisting of eight ocean bottom seismometers and hydrophones, was acquired in 2014. The profile was designed to univocally confirm the proposed oceanic nature of the IAP crust as a remnant of the Tethys and to confute its interpretation as a strongly thinned part of the African continental crust.

We used a population of the barnacle Balanus improvisus known to be sensitive to short-term acidification to determine its potential for long-term acclimation to acidification. We reared laboratory-bred individuals (as singles or pairs), and field-collected assemblages of barnacles, at pH 8.1 and 7.5 (% 400 and 1600 \u03bcatm pCO 2 respectively) for up to 16 months. Acidification caused strong mortality and reduced growth rates. Acidification suppressed respiration rates and induced a higher feeding activity of barnacles after 6 months, but this suppression of respiration rate was absent after 15 months.

We used a population of the barnacle Balanus improvisus known to be sensitive to short-term acidification to determine its potential for long-term acclimation to acidification. We reared laboratory-bred individuals (as singles or pairs), and field-collected assemblages of barnacles, at pH 8.1 and 7.5 (% 400 and 1600 \u03bcatm pCO 2 respectively) for up to 16 months. Acidification caused strong mortality and reduced growth rates. Acidification suppressed respiration rates and induced a higher feeding activity of barnacles after 6 months, but this suppression of respiration rate was absent after 15 months.

In a first step we developed a pre-processing workflow which considers viewing geometry issues (shoreline orientation, incidence angle relationships with respect to different landcover types). We distinguish between areas with foreshortening along cliffs facing the sensor, radar shadow along cliffs facing away and traditional land-water boundary discrimination. Results are compared to retrievals from Landsat trends. Four regions which feature high erosion rates have been selected. All three wavelengths have been investigated for Kay Point (Canadian Beaufort Sea Coast). C-and L-band have been studied at all sites, including also Herschel Island (Canadian Beaufort Sea Coast), Varandai (Barents Sea Coast, Russia), and Bykovsky Peninsula (Laptev Sea coast, Russia). Erosion rates have been derived for a 1-year period (2017-2018) and in case of L-band also over 11 years (2007)(2008)(2009)(2010)(2011)(2012)(2013)(2014)(2015)(2016)(2017)(2018). Results indicate applicability of all wavelengths, but acquisitions need to be selected with care to deal with potential ambiguities in scattering behavior. Furthermore, incidence angle dependencies need to be considered for discrimination of the land-water boundary in case of L-and C-band. However, L-band has the lowest sensitivity to wave action and relevant future missions are expected to be of value for coastal erosion monitoring. The utilization of trends derived from Landsat is also promising for efficient long-term trend retrieval. The high spatial resolution of TerraSAR-X staring spot light mode (< 1 m) also allows the use of radar shadow for cliff-top monitoring in all seasons. Derived retreat rates agree with rates available from other data sources, but the applicability for automatic retrieval is partially limited.

Spatial (horizontal and vertical) distribution of metazooplankton abundance and biomass was strongly correlated to chlorophyll-a concentration. In addition, a clear association was observed between the vertical distribution of nauplii and small copepods and the depth of the deep chlorophyll maximum. The distinction between the communities of the eastern and western basins was clearly explained by the environmental factors. The specific distribution pattern of remarkable species was also described."}

Conversely, the Red King Crab, Paralithodes camtschaticus, is adversely affected by acidification and so is expected to die back in the Barents Sea which it has invaded. Overall, we suspect that there will be an increase in nuisance species, as many have traits that are resilient to the combined warming and acidification caused by rising CO 2 levels; region-specific assessments are needed to understand responses of nuisance species in local habitats. Finally, we highlight the need for targeted studies of the effects of global change on particularly harmful marine taxa such as the seaweed Caulerpa taxifolia, the starfish Asterias amurensis, several invasive ascidians, and the lionfish Pterois volitans."}

This is even true for RP's complex continuation, which also treats the conductivity of the material. Firn is a mixture of ice and air. The DECOMP formula links the RP of the ice and its VF, with the RP of the firn. The inversion of the formula is, for most practical applications, possible; the density of firn as well as the ice's RP can then be determined with high spatial resolution from dielectric profiling measurements (DEP) alone. If the ice phase's density and the real component of RP are a constant material property the inversion is feasible.

This is even true for RP's complex continuation, which also treats the conductivity of the material. Firn is a mixture of ice and air. The DECOMP formula links the RP of the ice and its VF, with the RP of the firn. The inversion of the formula is, for most practical applications, possible; the density of firn as well as the ice's RP can then be determined with high spatial resolution from dielectric profiling measurements (DEP) alone. If the ice phase's density and the real component of RP are a constant material property the inversion is feasible.

Species- and individual-level traits strongly drove foraging substrate and behavioural niches, respectively, whereas the dietary niche was described by both. Our findings underscored the importance of species-level traits for community-level niches, but highlight that individual-level trait variation within a select few species may be a key driver of the overall size of niches."}

Oxygen binding parameters derived from measurements in only 15 \u03bcl of haemolymph from the cephalopod Octopus vulgaris showed low instrumental error (0.93%) and good agreement with published data. Broad-range spectra, each resolving 2048 data points, provided detailed insight into the complex absorbance characteristics of diverse blood types. After consideration of photobleaching and intrinsic fluorescence, pH optodes yielded accurate recordings and resolved a sigmoidal shift of 0.03 pH units in response to changing P O2 from 0 to 21 kPa. Highly resolved continuous recordings along pH gradients conformed to stepwise measurements at low rates of pH changes. In this study we showed that a diffusion chamber upgraded with a broad-range spectrophotometer and an optical pH sensor accurately characterizes oxygen binding with minimal sample consumption and manipulation. We conclude that the modified diffusion chamber is highly suitable for experimental biologists who demand high flexibility, detailed insight into oxygen binding as well as experimental and biological accuracy combined in a single setup."}

This study addresses the issue through the analysis of numerical experiments where a low-mode internal tide propagates through a quasigeostrophic turbulent jet. Equations of motion linearized around the slower turbulent field are projected onto vertical modes and assumed to describe the dynamics of the low-mode internal tide propagation. Diagnostics of the terms responsible for the interaction between the wave and the slow circulation are computed from the numerical outputs. The large-scale change of stratification, on top of eddies and jet meanders, contributes significantly to these interaction terms, which is shown to be consistent with an independent scaling analysis.

This study addresses the issue through the analysis of numerical experiments where a low-mode internal tide propagates through a quasigeostrophic turbulent jet. Equations of motion linearized around the slower turbulent field are projected onto vertical modes and assumed to describe the dynamics of the low-mode internal tide propagation. Diagnostics of the terms responsible for the interaction between the wave and the slow circulation are computed from the numerical outputs. The large-scale change of stratification, on top of eddies and jet meanders, contributes significantly to these interaction terms, which is shown to be consistent with an independent scaling analysis.

Some fishing practices, such as bottom trawling, have caused a widespread decline in exploited fish stocks. Bottom trawling is also expected to have negative impacts on benthic habitats, usually structured by and hosting a large array of invertebrate species, which provide important ecological services to fish and commercial invertebrate stocks. However, in contrast to commercial species for which long-term time series of the abundance exist, data on these habitat-forming invertebrates are scarce, as they are usually caught as bycatch and discarded. Therefore, there is great uncertainty about their long-term trends, and if these populations are stable or declining. Here we used interview surveys conducted with bottom-trawling fishers of the central Adriatic Sea to gather local ecological knowledge on megabenthos abundance occurring in their fishing domain, as an alternative source of information to conventional fisheries data. We interviewed 44 fishers, from the most important ports of the Marche region of Italy, to understand how megabenthic species have changed in abundance within the area since the 1980s. Specifically, we asked fishers to provide qualitative abundance scores for 18 invertebrate species in five phyla (Porifera, Cnidaria, Bryozoa, Mollusca, and Echinodermata) based on their recollection of these species\u2019 presence in bycatch. We stratified responses in homogeneous temporal periods and geographic sectors of the study area, and analyzed their response with mixed effect ordered logistic regression models in order to evaluate spatiotemporal changes in the perceived abundance of each species. Our analysis suggests that the abundance of the sponge Geodia cydonium, the molluscs Pecten jacobaeus, Atrina fragilis, Neopycnodonte cochlear, and the group of holothurians, have declined. From fishers\u2019 perceptions, only the bryozoan Amathia semiconvoluta has increased. Local ecological knowledge can provide important information on environmental change and can highlight species and ecosystems at risk when conventional scientific data are scarce or absent.

The collapse of the Larsen B Ice Shelf in 2002 has been attributed to the sudden drainage of \u223c 3000 surface lakes and has highlighted the potential for surface water to cause ice-shelf instability. Surface meltwater systems have been identified across numerous Antarctic ice shelves, although the extent to which these systems impact ice-shelf instability is poorly constrained. To better understand the role of surface meltwater systems on ice shelves, it is important to track their seasonal development, monitoring the fluctuations in surface water volume and the transfer of water across ice-shelf surfaces. Here, we use Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 imagery to track surface meltwater across the Nivlisen Ice Shelf in the 2016-2017 melt season. We develop the Fully Automated Supraglacial-Water Tracking algorithm for Ice Shelves (FASTISh) and use it to identify and track the development of 1598 water bodies, which we classify as either circular or linear.

Surface meltwater systems have been identified across numerous Antarctic ice shelves, although the extent to which these systems impact ice-shelf instability is poorly constrained. To better understand the role of surface meltwater systems on ice shelves, it is important to track their seasonal development, monitoring the fluctuations in surface water volume and the transfer of water across ice-shelf surfaces. Here, we use Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 imagery to track surface meltwater across the Nivlisen Ice Shelf in the 2016-2017 melt season. We develop the Fully Automated Supraglacial-Water Tracking algorithm for Ice Shelves (FASTISh) and use it to identify and track the development of 1598 water bodies, which we classify as either circular or linear. The total volume of surface meltwater peaks on 26 January 2017 at 5.5 \u00d7 10 7 m 3 . At this time, 63 % of the total volume is held within two linear surface meltwater systems, which are up to 27 km long, are orientated along the ice shelf's north-south axis, and follow the surface slope. Over the course of the melt season, they appear to migrate away from the grounding line, while growing in size and enveloping smaller water bodies. This suggests there is large-scale lateral water transfer through the surface meltwater system and the firn pack towards the ice-shelf front during the summer."}

These icebergs and associated meltwater flux are hypothesized to have led to a shutdown of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and severe cooling in large parts of the Northern Hemisphere. However, due to the limited availability of high-resolution records, the magnitude of sea surface temperature (SST) changes related to the impact of Heinrich events on the midlatitude North Atlantic is poorly constrained. Here we present a record of U K 37 0-based SSTs derived from sediments of Integrated Ocean Drilling Project Site U1313, located at the southern end of the ice-rafted debris (IRD) belt in the midlatitude North Atlantic (41 N). We demonstrate that all six Heinrich events are associated with a rapid warming of surface waters by 2-4 C in a few thousand years. The presence of IRD leaves no doubt about the simultaneous timing and correlation between rapid surface water warming and Heinrich events. We argue that this warming in the midlatitude North Atlantic is related to a northward expansion of the subtropical gyre during Heinrich events. As a wide range of studies demonstrated that in the central IRD belt Heinrich events are associated with low SSTs, these results thus identify an antiphased (seesaw) pattern in SSTs during Heinrich events between the midlatitude (warm) and northern North Atlantic (cold). This highlights the complex response of surface water characteristics in the North Atlantic to Heinrich events that is poorly reproduced by freshwater hosing experiments and challenges the widely accepted view that, within the IRD belt of the North Atlantic, Heinrich events coincide with periods of low SSTs.", "title": "Warming of surface waters in the mid-latitude North Atlantic during Heinrich events", "query": "During the six Heinrich events of the last 70 kyr, episodic calving from the circum-Atlantic ice sheets released large numbers of icebergs into the North Atlantic.

Here we present a record of U K 37 0-based SSTs derived from sediments of Integrated Ocean Drilling Project Site U1313, located at the southern end of the ice-rafted debris (IRD) belt in the midlatitude North Atlantic (41 N). We demonstrate that all six Heinrich events are associated with a rapid warming of surface waters by 2-4 C in a few thousand years. The presence of IRD leaves no doubt about the simultaneous timing and correlation between rapid surface water warming and Heinrich events. We argue that this warming in the midlatitude North Atlantic is related to a northward expansion of the subtropical gyre during Heinrich events. As a wide range of studies demonstrated that in the central IRD belt Heinrich events are associated with low SSTs, these results thus identify an antiphased (seesaw) pattern in SSTs during Heinrich events between the midlatitude (warm) and northern North Atlantic (cold). This highlights the complex response of surface water characteristics in the North Atlantic to Heinrich events that is poorly reproduced by freshwater hosing experiments and challenges the widely accepted view that, within the IRD belt of the North Atlantic, Heinrich events coincide with periods of low SSTs."}

A recent study revealed a frequency of ~2% spontaneous (i.e., non-intentional) triploidy in domesticated Atlantic salmon produced in Norwegian aquaculture in the period 2007-2014. In contrast, the frequency of triploidy in wild salmon populations has not been studied thus far, and in wild populations of other organisms, it has been very rarely studied.

Here, we critically re-investigated the microsatellite genetic profile of ~6000 wild Atlantic salmon sampled from 80 rivers in Norway and Russia, to investigate the frequency of triploid individuals in wild salmon populations for the first time.Results: We detected a single triploid salmon, and five individuals displaying three alleles at one of the loci, thus regarded as putatively trisomic.

Already today, coastal regions experience episodic pH events during which surface layer pH drops below values projected for the surface ocean at the end of the century. Future OA is expected to further enhance the intensity of these coastal extreme pH events. To evaluate the influence of such episodic OA events in coastal regions, we deployed eight pelagic mesocosms for 53 days in Raunefjord, Norway, and enclosed 56\u201361 m3 of local seawater containing a natural plankton community under nutrient limited post-bloom conditions. Four mesocosms were enriched with CO2 to simulate extreme pCO2 levels of 1978 \u2013 2069 \u03bcatm while the other four served as untreated controls. Here, we present results from multivariate analyses on OA-induced changes in the phyto-, micro-, and mesozooplankton community structure. Pronounced differences in the plankton community emerged early in the experiment, and were amplified by enhanced top-down control throughout the study period. The plankton groups responding most profoundly to high CO2 conditions were cyanobacteria (negative), chlorophyceae (negative), auto- and heterotrophic microzooplankton (negative), and a variety of mesozooplanktonic taxa, including copepoda (mixed), appendicularia (positive), hydrozoa (positive), fish larvae (positive), and gastropoda (negative). The restructuring of the community coincided with significant changes in the concentration and elemental stoichiometry of particulate organic matter. Results imply that extreme CO2 events can lead to a substantial reorganization of the planktonic food web, affecting multiple trophic levels from phytoplankton to primary and secondary consumers.

Already today, coastal regions experience episodic pH events during which surface layer pH drops below values projected for the surface ocean at the end of the century. Future OA is expected to further enhance the intensity of these coastal extreme pH events. To evaluate the influence of such episodic OA events in coastal regions, we deployed eight pelagic mesocosms for 53 days in Raunefjord, Norway, and enclosed 56\u201361 m3 of local seawater containing a natural plankton community under nutrient limited post-bloom conditions. Four mesocosms were enriched with CO2 to simulate extreme pCO2 levels of 1978 \u2013 2069 \u03bcatm while the other four served as untreated controls. Here, we present results from multivariate analyses on OA-induced changes in the phyto-, micro-, and mesozooplankton community structure. Pronounced differences in the plankton community emerged early in the experiment, and were amplified by enhanced top-down control throughout the study period. The plankton groups responding most profoundly to high CO2 conditions were cyanobacteria (negative), chlorophyceae (negative), auto- and heterotrophic microzooplankton (negative), and a variety of mesozooplanktonic taxa, including copepoda (mixed), appendicularia (positive), hydrozoa (positive), fish larvae (positive), and gastropoda (negative). The restructuring of the community coincided with significant changes in the concentration and elemental stoichiometry of particulate organic matter. Results imply that extreme CO2 events can lead to a substantial reorganization of the planktonic food web, affecting multiple trophic levels from phytoplankton to primary and secondary consumers.

Nonetheless, not all species are vulnerable to those OA threats, e.g. some species may be able to cope with OA stress using environmentally induced modifications on gene and protein expressions. For example, external environmental stressors including OA can influence the addition and removal of methyl groups through epigenetic modification (e.g. DNA methylation) process to turn gene expression \\on or off\\ as part of a rapid adaptive mechanism to cope with OA. In this study, we tested the above hypothesis through testing the effect of OA, using decreased pH 7.4 as proxy, on DNA methylation pattern of an endemic and a commercially important estuary oyster species, Crassostrea hongkongensis at the time of larval habitat selection and metamorphosis. Larval growth rate did not differ between control pH 8.1 and treatment pH 7.4.

Nonetheless, not all species are vulnerable to those OA threats, e.g. some species may be able to cope with OA stress using environmentally induced modifications on gene and protein expressions. For example, external environmental stressors including OA can influence the addition and removal of methyl groups through epigenetic modification (e.g. DNA methylation) process to turn gene expression \\on or off\\ as part of a rapid adaptive mechanism to cope with OA. In this study, we tested the above hypothesis through testing the effect of OA, using decreased pH 7.4 as proxy, on DNA methylation pattern of an endemic and a commercially important estuary oyster species, Crassostrea hongkongensis at the time of larval habitat selection and metamorphosis. Larval growth rate did not differ between control pH 8.1 and treatment pH 7.4. The metamorphosis rate of the pediveliger larvae was higher at pH 7.4 than those in control pH 8.1, however over one-third of the larvae raised at pH 7.4 failed to attach on optimal substrate as defined by biofilm presence. During larval development, a total of 130 genes were differentially methylated across the two treatments. The differential methylation in the larval genes may have partially accounted for the higher metamorphosis success rate under decreased pH 7.4 but with poor substratum selection ability. Differentially methylated loci were concentrated in the exon regions and appear to be associated with cytoskeletal and signal transduction, oxidative stress, metabolic processes, and larval metamorphosis, which implies the high potential of C. hongkongensis larvae to acclimate and adapt through non-genetic ways to OA threats within a single generation."}

This set includes samples that run in a transect from source to sink along the Tagus River and out to the deep ocean off the Portuguese margin spanning the last 6000 years. We found that although pH reconstructions in the soils were improved using the new calibration, MAT reconstructions were not much better even with the separa- tion of the 5- and 6-methyl brGDGTs. This con\ufb01rmed the conclusion of previous studies that the amount of aquatically produced brGDGTs is overwhelming the soil-derived ones in marine sediments and complicating MAT reconstructions in the region. Additionally, the new separation revealed a strong and until now unseen relationship between the new degree of cyclization (DC\u2019) of the brGDGTs and MAT that could be making temperature reconstructions in this and other arid re- gions dif\ufb01cult."}

In this region, the mixed layer heat budget is characterized by a strong annual cycle mainly modulated by the shortwave radiation annual cycle. During the austral fall and winter, the shortwave radiation input minimum is overwhelmed by the heat loss mainly because of the latent heat flux. The mixed layer salt budget also presents a strong annual cycle with a minimum of salt content during the late austral winter.

In this region, the mixed layer heat budget is characterized by a strong annual cycle mainly modulated by the shortwave radiation annual cycle. During the austral fall and winter, the shortwave radiation input minimum is overwhelmed by the heat loss mainly because of the latent heat flux. The mixed layer salt budget also presents a strong annual cycle with a minimum of salt content during the late austral winter.

We conclude that no NA runoff can be demonstrated unequivocally anywhere during our expedition with the set of tracers considered here. Small contributions of NA runoff may have been masked by Ba depletion and could only be resolved by supportive tracers on the uptake history. We thus suggest that Ba has to be used with care as it can put limits but not yield quantitative water mass distributions. Only if the extra Ba inputs exceed the cumulative biological uptake the signal can be unequivocally attributed to NA runoff."}

Ocean acidification caused a decrease in haemolymph pH. The extracellular acidosis remained largely uncompensated despite some bicarbonate accumulation. In all treatments animals developed a progressive warming-induced extracellular acidosis. A stronger pH drop at around 25 \u00b0C was followed by stagnating heart rates. However, normocapnic mussels enhanced bicarbonate accumulation at the critical limit, a strategy no longer available to hypercapnic mussels. In conclusion, CO 2 has small effects on the response patterns of mussels to warming, leaving thermal thresholds largely unaffected. High resilience of adult North Sea mussels to future ocean acidification indicates that sensitivity to thermal stress is more relevant in shaping the response to future climate change."}

Here we present the measurements of dissolved NO in the surface and bottom layers at 75 stations in the Bohai Sea (BS) and the Yellow Sea (YS) in June 2011. Moreover, NO photoproduction rates were determined at 27 stations in both seas. The NO concentrations in the surface and bottom layers were highly variable and ranged from below the limit of detection (i.e., 32 pmol L \u22121 ) to 616 pmol L \u22121 in the surface layer and 482 pmol L \u22121 in the bottom layer. There was no significant difference (p>0.05) between the mean NO concentrations in the surface (186 \u00b1 108 pmol L \u22121 ) and bottom (174 \u00b1 123 pmol L \u22121 ) layers.

Moreover, NO photoproduction rates were determined at 27 stations in both seas. The NO concentrations in the surface and bottom layers were highly variable and ranged from below the limit of detection (i.e., 32 pmol L \u22121 ) to 616 pmol L \u22121 in the surface layer and 482 pmol L \u22121 in the bottom layer. There was no significant difference (p>0.05) between the mean NO concentrations in the surface (186 \u00b1 108 pmol L \u22121 ) and bottom (174 \u00b1 123 pmol L \u22121 ) layers.

Similarly, when presented with crustose coralline algae (CCA) pre-conditioned in seawater pH of either pH 8.1 or 7.7 for 28 days, larval settlement success remained unaltered (on indirect effects). We conclude that competent larvae in this species are resilient to OA at time of settlement. Further research on a range of taxa that vary in settlement selectivity and behaviour is needed in order to fully understand the effects of OA on the life cycle of marine invertebrates and the consequences it might have for future coastal marine ecosystems."}

However, the behavior of Mo during early diagenesis is still not fully understood, which complicates the application of the Mo proxy in ancient continental margin environments. Here, we present Mo concentrations and isotope compositions of sediment and pore water samples from the Guaymas Basin in the Gulf of California. Our sample set covers a broad range of depositional environments, including sediments from within the eastern equatorial Pacific oxygen minimum zone (OMZ), from a semi-restricted oxic graben, and from near a hydrothermal vent-field. By investigating Mo cycling in these different settings, we provide new insights into different modes of Mo fixation and the associated isotope fractionation. Sediments from the OMZ have authigenic Mo concentrations (Moauth) between 3.3 and 17.2 \u00b5g/g and \u03b498Mo between +1.64 and +2.13\u2030. A linear decrease in pore water Mo concentrations to the depth where hydrogen sulfide accumulates, along with sedimentary authigenic \u03b498Mo values (\u03b498Moauth) close to seawater, indicate diffusion of Mo from the bottom water into the sediment with little isotope fractionation during quantitative Mo removal.

Pore water Mo concentrations are generally higher than ambient bottom water concentrations and the light \u03b498Mo signatures of the pore waters between +0.50 and +0.80\u2030 and \u03b498Moauth signatures of the sediments indicate continuous Mo exchange between the pore water and Mn and Fe oxides during early diagenesis.

The occurrence of mesoscale eddies that develop suboxic environments at shallow depth (about 40\u2013100m) has recently been reported for the eastern tropical North Atlantic (ETNA).

Particulate mass, carbon (organic and inorganic) (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) export fluxes were measured at the equator in the western and central Pacific during two 67 day-long time-series stations located in the warm pool (TS-I at 0\u201d, 167\u201dE) and in the equatorial HNLC situation (TS-II at O\u201d, 15O\u201dW), using drifting sediment traps deployed for 48 h at four depths (between, approximately, 100 and 300 m). The particulate organic carbon (POC) fluxes at the base of the euphotic zone (0. I % light level), were approximately four times lower at TS-I than at TS-II (4.1 VS. 17.0 mmol C me2 day-\u2018). Conversely, fluxes measured at 300 m were similar at both sites (3.6 vs. 3.7 mmol C m-\u2019 day-\u2019 at TS-I and TS-II, respectively). This change in export fluxes was in good agreement with food-web dynamics in the euphotic zone characterized by an increase in plankton biomasses and metabolic rates and a shift towards larger size from TS-I to TS-II. The POC flux profiles indicated high remineralization (up to 78%) of the exported particles at TS-II, between 100 and 200 m in the Equatorial Undercurrent. According to zooplankton ingestion estimates from 100-300 m, 60% of this POC loss could be accounted for by zooplankton grazing. At TS-I, no marked increase of flux with depth was observed, and we assume that loss of particles was compensated by in-situ particle production by zooplankton. Fluxes of particulate nitrogen and phosphorus followed the same general patterns as the POC fluxes. The elemental and pigment composition of the exported particles was not very different between the two stations. In particular, the POC:PN flux molar ratio at the base of the euphotic zone was low, 6.9 and 6.2 at TS-I and TS-II, respectively. For particulate inorganic carbon (mainly carbonate) flux, values at the base of the euphotic zone averaged 0.9 mmol C me2 day-\u2019 at TS-I and 2.3 mmol Cm-2 day- \u2019 at TS-II (corresponding to a 2.6-fold increase) and showed low depth changes at both stations. POC export flux (including active flux associated with the interzonal migrants) at the 0.1% light level depth represented only 8% of primary production (i4C uptake) measured at TS-I and 19% at TS-II. For the time and space scales considered in the present study, new primary production, as measured by the \u201cN method, was in good agreement with the total export flux in the HNLC situation, thus leading to negligible dissolved organic carbon (DOC) or nitrogen (DON) losses from the photic zone. Conversely, export flux was found to be only 50% (C units) and 60% (N) of new production in the oligotrophic system, either because of an overestimation by the 15N method or of a significant export of DOC and DON.

Reducing the un- certainties in climate change modeling requires a better un- derstanding of the aerosol optical properties, and for this we need accurate data on the aerosol refractive index (RI). Due to the remoteness of Antarctica only very few RI data are available from this region (Hogan et al., 1979; Virkkula et al., 2006; Shepherd et al., 2018). We calculate the real refractive index of natural atmospheric aerosols from number size dis- tribution measurements at the German coastal Antarctic sta- tion Neumayer III. Given the high average scattering albedo of 0.992 (Weller et al., 2013), we assumed that the imagi- nary part of the RI is zero. Our method uses the overlapping size range (particle diameter D between 120 and 340 nm) of a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS), which sizes the particles by their electrical mobility, and a laser aerosol spectrometer (LAS), which sizes the particles by their optical scattering signal at the 633 nm wavelength. Based on almost a complete year of measurement, the av- erage effective refractive index (RIeff, as we call our retrieved RI because of the used assumptions) for the dry aerosol par- ticles turned out to be 1.44 with a standard deviation of 0.08, in a good agreement with the RI value of 1.47, which we derived from the chemical composition of bulk aerosol sampling measurements. At Neumayer the aerosol shows a pronounced seasonal pattern in both number concentration and chemical composition. Despite this, the variability of the monthly averaged RIeff values remained between 1.40 and 1.50. Compared to the annual mean, two austral win- ter months (July and September) showed slightly but signif- icantly increased values (1.50 and 1.47, respectively). The size dependency of the RIeff could be determined from time- averaged LAS and SMPS number size distributions mea- sured between December 2017 and January 2018. Here we calculated RIeff for four different particle size ranges and ob- served a slight decrease from 1.47 (D range 116\u2013168 nm) to 1.37 (D range 346\u2013478 nm).

These were grown in the natural environment as well as in controlled culturing experiments under different pH conditions (ranging from 7.35 to 8.15 \u00b1 0.05) over different time intervals (214 to 335 days). Details of shell microstructural features, such as thickness of the primary layer, density and size of endopunctae and morphology of the basic structural unit of the secondary layer were analysed using scanning electron microscopy. Stable isotope compositions (\u03b4 13 C and \u03b4 18 O) were tested from the secondary shell layer along shell ontogenetic increments in both dorsal and ventral valves. Based on our comprehensive dataset, we observed that, under low-pH conditions, M. venosa produced a more organic-rich shell with higher density of and larger endopunctae, and smaller secondary layer fibres. Also, increasingly negative \u03b4 13 C and \u03b4 18 O values are recorded by the shell produced during culturing and are related to the CO 2 source in the culture set-up.

Increased anthropogenic CO2 release leads to ocean acidification and is expected to alter phytoplankton community composition, primary production rates and bacterial degradation processes in the coming decades with potential consequences for dissolved and particulate OC concentration and composition. Here we investigate effects of increased pCO2 on dissolved and particulate amino acids (AA) and carbohydrates (CHO), in arctic and sub-arctic planktonic communities in two large-scale mesocosm experiments. Dissolved AA concentrations responded to pCO2/pH changes during early bloom phases but did not show many changes after nutrient addition.

Increased anthropogenic CO2 release leads to ocean acidification and is expected to alter phytoplankton community composition, primary production rates and bacterial degradation processes in the coming decades with potential consequences for dissolved and particulate OC concentration and composition. Here we investigate effects of increased pCO2 on dissolved and particulate amino acids (AA) and carbohydrates (CHO), in arctic and sub-arctic planktonic communities in two large-scale mesocosm experiments. Dissolved AA concentrations responded to pCO2/pH changes during early bloom phases but did not show many changes after nutrient addition.

Many zones have also been identified that are suitable to host windfarms. A good understanding of interactions between these activities is necessary in order to estimate, forestall and manage risks of major spatial conflicts. Besides, their potential interactions with marine populations have not yet been well established. Several Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have been created in the Channel in the past few years, to protect key habitats or populations, or are still being discussed. It is necessary to predict to what extent these MPAs can be an asset for a sustainable exploitation of marine resources, and what their effects will be on the organisation of sectors that depend on these resources. Thus, modelling becomes a relevant approach. One major issue when trying to model marine ecosystems is that they have high uncertainties: marine populations and fishing intensity are very variable, and their state is often poorly known. These uncertainties increase risks that ecosystem management goals may not be reached. Therefore, management measures that are robust to uncertainties and minimise these risks have to be found. Methods have been developed within Decision Theory that aim at allowing decision making under severe uncertainty. One of these methods is the information-gap decision theory. The info-gap method has started to permeate ecological modelling, with recent applications to conservation. However, these practical applications have so far been restricted to rather simple models with analytical solutions. Here we set up a nonprobabilistic management measures robustness assessment approach based on decision theory for a complex, non-analytical model. This approach is applied to the management of the Eastern Channel flatfish fishery. Using the ISIS-Fish modelling platform, we model populations of sole and plaice in this area. A wide range of values of management parameters is tested, so that we can determine which values allow reaching maximum sustainable yield (MSY) with the highest robustness to uncertainties. This model is then further enhanced in order to evaluate the impacts of human activities on various elements of the Eastern Channel ecosystem, in a context of developing spatial management. Effects of MPAs on fishing activities, fish and benthic populations are modelled according to information found in the literature. Impacts of sediment extraction on benthic communities can be determined by means of data obtained on experimental dredging sites located in the Bay of Seine. This study took place from 2007 to 2012, the analysis being performed at the level of the trophic guilds that appear in the diets of sole and plaice. Based on these data, we determine the dynamics of benthic populations at the trophic guild level on dredged sites and on reference sites. These dynamics are then included in the ISIS-Fish model of the area. Finally, we test various management scenarios corresponding to different levels of access limitations to Marine Protected Areas.

Many zones have also been identified that are suitable to host windfarms. A good understanding of interactions between these activities is necessary in order to estimate, forestall and manage risks of major spatial conflicts. Besides, their potential interactions with marine populations have not yet been well established. Several Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have been created in the Channel in the past few years, to protect key habitats or populations, or are still being discussed. It is necessary to predict to what extent these MPAs can be an asset for a sustainable exploitation of marine resources, and what their effects will be on the organisation of sectors that depend on these resources. Thus, modelling becomes a relevant approach. One major issue when trying to model marine ecosystems is that they have high uncertainties: marine populations and fishing intensity are very variable, and their state is often poorly known. These uncertainties increase risks that ecosystem management goals may not be reached. Therefore, management measures that are robust to uncertainties and minimise these risks have to be found. Methods have been developed within Decision Theory that aim at allowing decision making under severe uncertainty. One of these methods is the information-gap decision theory. The info-gap method has started to permeate ecological modelling, with recent applications to conservation. However, these practical applications have so far been restricted to rather simple models with analytical solutions. Here we set up a nonprobabilistic management measures robustness assessment approach based on decision theory for a complex, non-analytical model. This approach is applied to the management of the Eastern Channel flatfish fishery. Using the ISIS-Fish modelling platform, we model populations of sole and plaice in this area. A wide range of values of management parameters is tested, so that we can determine which values allow reaching maximum sustainable yield (MSY) with the highest robustness to uncertainties. This model is then further enhanced in order to evaluate the impacts of human activities on various elements of the Eastern Channel ecosystem, in a context of developing spatial management. Effects of MPAs on fishing activities, fish and benthic populations are modelled according to information found in the literature. Impacts of sediment extraction on benthic communities can be determined by means of data obtained on experimental dredging sites located in the Bay of Seine. This study took place from 2007 to 2012, the analysis being performed at the level of the trophic guilds that appear in the diets of sole and plaice. Based on these data, we determine the dynamics of benthic populations at the trophic guild level on dredged sites and on reference sites. These dynamics are then included in the ISIS-Fish model of the area. Finally, we test various management scenarios corresponding to different levels of access limitations to Marine Protected Areas. Among all scenarios tested, we search for those that allow reaching management goals, despite potentially large uncertainties on several parameters linked to the environment, human behavior, or fish biology., La Manche orientale est une zone strat\u00e9gique supportant de nombreuses activit\u00e9s humaines, notamment la p\u00eache, le transport de marchandises, l'extraction de granulats et le tourisme.

Furthermore, we simulated an upwelling event by adding 650 m-depth nutrient-rich water to the mesocosms, which initiated a phytoplankton bloom. No effects of pCO2 on the zooplankton community were visible in the oligotrophic conditions before the bloom. The zooplankton community responded to phytoplankton bloom by increased abundances in all treatments, although the response was delayed under high-pCO2 conditions. Microzooplankton was dominated by small dinoflagellates and aloricate ciliates, which were more abundant under medium- to high-pCO2 conditions. The most abundant mesozooplankters were calanoid copepods, which did not respond to CO2 treatments during the oligotrophic phase of the experiment but were found in higher abundance under medium- and high-pCO2 conditions toward the end of the experiment, most likely as a response to increased phyto- and microzooplankton standing stocks. The second most abundant mesozooplankton taxon were appendicularians, which did not show a response to the different pCO2 treatments.

Due to the large difference in microstructure between finer-grained ice and the coarse-grained ice at premelting temperatures (T > 262 K), it is expected that the fine-grained layers deform at high strain rates, while the coarse-grained layers are relatively stagnant. The difference in microstructure, and consequently in viscosity, between impurity-rich and low-impurity ice can have important consequences for ice dynamics close to the bedrock."}

The most favourable climatic conditions and comparatively higher water level stands are inferred for the early Atlantic. Towards the end of this period the gradual transition to a wetland with poor-fen character took place. Within the Subboreal there was a short episode with mild climate conditions. At that time the last trees occurred in the Labaz Lake area and somewhat higher water level stands were likely. The Subatlantic climate deterioration led to further drying up of the wetland along with a lowering of water pH and permafrost aggradation. The transition from a locality with low-centre to one with high-centre polygons is still underway."}

Here, we compare the megafauna from two sites located at different distances from the Kongsfjord: one station at the entrance to the fjord, another on the outer shelf. Although they are only located 25 km apart and at comparable depth, there were significant differences in their species composition. While the inshore station was characterized by shrimps (2.5792.18 ind. m (2 ) and brittlestars (3.219 3.21 ind. m (2 ), the offshore site harboured even higher brittlestar densities (15.2399.32 ind. m (2 ) and high numbers of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus pallidus (1.2391.09 ind. m (2 ). Phytodetrital concentrations of the upper sediment centimetres were significantly higher inshore compared with offshore. At a smaller scale, there were also differences in the composition of different transect sections. Several taxa were characterized by a patchy distribution along transects.

Although they are only located 25 km apart and at comparable depth, there were significant differences in their species composition. While the inshore station was characterized by shrimps (2.5792.18 ind. m (2 ) and brittlestars (3.219 3.21 ind. m (2 ), the offshore site harboured even higher brittlestar densities (15.2399.32 ind. m (2 ) and high numbers of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus pallidus (1.2391.09 ind. m (2 ). Phytodetrital concentrations of the upper sediment centimetres were significantly higher inshore compared with offshore.

The in\ufb02uence of organic ligands in the Fe(II) speciation diminished as pH decreased in solution. During the stationary growth phase, the FeCHO+ complex became the most important contributor to the overall oxidation rate when pH was lower than 7.95. Because CO2 levels modify the composition of excreted organic ligands, the redox behavior of Fe in solution may be affected by future acidi\ufb01cation conditions."}
