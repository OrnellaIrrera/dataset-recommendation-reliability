Economic Experiments and Ethnographic Evidence From Fifteen SmallScale Societies What motives underlie the ways humans interact socially Are these the same for all societies Are these part of our

experiments suggest that people care not only about their own material payoffs but also about such things as fairness equity and reciprocity However this research left fundamental questions unanswered Are such social preferences stable components of human nature or are they modulated by economic social and cultural environments Until now experimental research could not address this question because virtually all subjects had been university students and while there are cultural differences among student populations throughout the world these differences are small compared to the full range of human social and cultural environments A vast amount of ethnographic and historical research suggests that peoples motives are influenced by economic social and cultural environments yet such methods can only yield circumstantial evidence about human motives Combining ethnographic and experimental approaches to fill this gap this book breaks new ground in reporting the results of a large crosscultural study aimed at determining the sources of social nonselfish preferences that underlie the diversity of human sociality The same experiments which provided evidence for social preferences among university students were performed in fifteen smallscale societies exhibiting a wide variety of social economic and cultural conditions by experienced field researchers who had also done longterm ethnographic field work in these societies The findings of these experiments demonstrated that no society in which experimental behaviour is consistent with the canonical model of

Programs on Earnings GOVERNMENTAL postschooling training programs have become a permanent fixture of the US economy in the last decade These programs are typically advocated for diverse reasons 1 to reduce inflation by the provision of more skilled workers to alleviate shortages 2 to reduce unemployment of certain groups and 3 to reduce poverty by increasing the skills of certain groups All of these objectives require that training programs increase the earnings of trainees above what they otherwise would be For example alleviating shortages by training more highly skilled workers should increase the earnings of these workers Likewise the concern for unemployed workers is derived from a concern for the decreased earnings of these workers and if trainees subsequently suffer less unemployment their earnings should be higher Finally training programs are intended to reduce poverty by increasing the earnings of low income workers Evaluating the success of training programs is thus inherently a quantitative assessment of the effect of training on trainee earnings It is an important process both because it helps to inform discussions of public policy by shedding light on the past value of these programs as investments and because it can provide a means of testing our ability to augment the human capital of certain workers Although there have been many studies of the effect of postschool classroom training on earnings it is by now rather widely agreed that very little is reliably known about the actual effects of these programs2 Three main problems account for this state of affairs 1 the large sample sizes required to detect relatively small anticipated program effects in a variable with such high variance as earnings 2 the considerable expense required to keep track of trainees over a long enough period of time to measure the full intertemporal impact of training and 3 the extreme difficulty of implementing an adequate experimental design so as to obtain a group against which to reliably compare trainees3 The purpose of this paper is to report on efforts to cope with this third problem using a data collection system that comes some way towards
