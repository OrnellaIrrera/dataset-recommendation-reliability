In order to provide an accurate diagnosis, clinicians must perform a search in the repositories of open data available to the research community. Nevertheless, the vast amount of heterogeneous and dispersed data sources that store information about gene-disease associations as well as their variable level of quality hinder the process of determining if the variants found in the DNA sequence of a patients sample are clinically relevant. In this paper, we present a systematic method based on conceptual modeling and data quality management techniques to tackle the aforementioned issues with the aim of helping the genomic diagnosis of a disease. To this end, we state the most prominent problems affecting repositories of open data for genomics. Then, we use a methodological approach for identifying what we called smart data: the relevant information hidden in the genomics data lake. Finally, in order to test and validate the proposed method, we apply it to a case study based on the clinical diagnosis of Crohns Disease.\"", "title": "\"A Method to Identify Relevant Genome Data: Conceptual Modeling for the Medicine of Precision.\"", "year": 0, "variants": ["https://makg.org/entity/2893359941"]}

In addition, updates just need a single round trip and modify the state 'in-place' without the need for a log. Furthermore, the message size overhead for coordination consists of a single counter per message. While reads in the presence of concurrent updates are not wait-free without a coordinator, we show that more than 97,% of reads can be handled in one or two round trips under highly concurrent accesses.

Cooperators also competed with each other, and strived to gain advantage even in a group that depends on cooperation for its own survival. How should that happen in humans? Evolutionary theory offered, from my point of view, the best perspective to understand these apparently opposing behaviors. For many years, I looked at cooperation in children, using game theory as an instrument to gain some insights. An invitation to participate in a symposium on religious behavior inspired me to look at a behavior that often comes together with both cooperation and competitiongroup coalition. So, I used religion, or its absence, as the factor promoting cooperation. After almost 30 years studying cooperation, more than ten of them in humans, I believe I have unveiled some of the motives that lead both humans as well as marmosets to collaborate and to compete.

The research on a cooperative breeder species, the common marmoset, made it clear to me that cooperation was not a straightforward phenomenon. Cooperators also competed with each other, and strived to gain advantage even in a group that depends on cooperation for its own survival. How should that happen in humans? Evolutionary theory offered, from my point of view, the best perspective to understand these apparently opposing behaviors. For many years, I looked at cooperation in children, using game theory as an instrument to gain some insights. An invitation to participate in a symposium on religious behavior inspired me to look at a behavior that often comes together with both cooperation and competitiongroup coalition. So, I used religion, or its absence, as the factor promoting cooperation. After almost 30 years studying cooperation, more than ten of them in humans, I believe I have unveiled some of the motives that lead both humans as well as marmosets to collaborate and to compete.

For the special case of optimizing average rank for linear ranking functions, however, the recently developed SVM-PropRank method has shown that counterfactual inference techniques can be used to provably overcome the distorting effect of presentation bias. Going beyond this special case, this paper provides a general and theoretically rigorous framework for counterfactual learning-to-rank that enables unbiased training for a broad class of additive ranking metrics (e.g., Discounted Cumulative Gain (DCG)) as well as a broad class of models (e.g., deep networks). Specifically, we derive a relaxation for propensity-weighted rank-based metrics which is subdifferentiable and thus suitable for gradient-based optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this general approach by instantiating two new learning methods. One is a new type of unbiased SVM that optimizes DCG - called SVM PropDCG - and we show how the resulting optimization problem can be solved via the Convex Concave Procedure (CCP). The other is Deep PropDCG, where the ranking function can be an arbitrary deep network.

This paper examines the relationship between amenities of tourist destination and their effect on tourist spending by examining (a) the mediating role of destination branding and (b) the moderating role of re-visit intention in the relationship between amenities and destination brand image. An online survey used to collect data from 150 Greek and 370 Chinese participants. Results show that destination brand image mediates the relationship between amenities of the destination and tourist spending. Moderated mediation reveals that the indirect paths (destination brand image) through which amenities exerts its effect on destination brand image is dependent on the value of tourist re-visit intention. Surprisingly, the model did not perform with Greek data. The role of destination brand image and tourist re-visit intention on tourist spending discussed together with future research directions.\"", "structured_info": "\"The Role of Destination Brand Image and Revisit Intention on Tourist Spending\" \"There has been a substantial rise in the number of tourists in coastal cities in Asia and Europe. Yet very little is known about their tourism spending behavior, particularly how their perceived the importance of amenities in destination brand image and their influence on re-visit intention.

Automatically assessed assignments, used with formative purposes, can support teaching and learning from several perspectives, such as conceptual and procedural understanding, metacognition, enactment of adaptive strategies, and teachers management of the class. This paper reports on an experimentation where automatic assessment has been used in a blended modality according to a model of formative assessment and interactive feedback to enhance learning. The experiment involved a total number of 546 students of 8th grade in the town of Turin (Italy). The use of the automatic assessment is shown and exemplified. Data from learning tests, questionnaire and platform usage are analyzed and used to show the effectiveness of the interactive materials for enhancing mathematical understanding and self-assessment skills. Moreover, a profile of the students who did not use the online opportunities, defined as reluctant users, is drawn and discussed.\"", "structured_info": "\"Advantages of Using Automatic Formative Assessment for Learning Mathematics.\" \"Automatic Assessment Systems empowered by mathematical engines allow the development of online assignments for Mathematics, which goes beyond multiple-choice modality.

We then introduce the joint frailty-copula model that formulates the shared frailty model for heterogeneity in a meta-analysis, and utilizes a copula for dependence between TTP and OS. To account for the effect that TTP is dependently censored by death, a likelihood function is derived under the semi-competing risks setting.
