## Generalizability

For each method we provide the code used to run each method on different data, the data, and the code to preprocess data so that they could be used on each method. Data published by other authors, hence data before pre-processing, is available in the original repositories.

Some folders are in archive form due to space problems. The LinearSVM, Bi-encoder and Ensemble codes run with our datasets are those provided in the original repositories of the authors.

The preprocessing files are not needed to run the code, the preprocessed data are available in the data folder of each method. However, the preprocessing files have been added for completeness.
